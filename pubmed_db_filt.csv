"['Södersten P', 'Bergh C', 'Leon M', 'Zandian M.']",Dopamine and anorexia nervosa.,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,"We have suggested that reduced food intake increases the risk for anorexia nervosa by engaging mesolimbic dopamine neurons, thereby initially rewarding dieting. Recent fMRI studies have confirmed that dopamine neurons are activated in anorexia nervosa, but it is not clear whether this response is due to the disorder or to its resulting nutritional deficit. When the body senses the shortage of nutrients, it rapidly shifts behavior toward foraging for food as a normal physiological response and the mesolimbic dopamine neurons may be involved in that process. On the other hand, the altered dopamine status of anorexics has been suggested to result from a brain abnormality that underlies their complex emotional disorder. We suggest that the outcomes of the treatments that emerge from that perspective remain poor because they target the mental symptoms that are actually the consequences of the food deprivation that accompanies anorexia. On the other hand, a method that normalizes the disordered eating behavior of anorexics results in much better physiological, behavioral, and emotional outcomes."
"['Schalla MA', 'Stengel A.']",The Role of Ghrelin in Anorexia Nervosa.,Int J Mol Sci,"Ghrelin, a 28-amino acid peptide hormone expressed in X/A-like endocrine cells of the stomach, is the only known peripherally produced and centrally acting peptide that stimulates food intake and therefore attracted a lot of attention with one major focus on the treatment of conditions where an increased energy intake or body weight gain is desired. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a pronounced reduction of body weight, a disturbed body image and hormonal alterations. Ghrelin signaling has been thoroughly investigated under conditions of anorexia nervosa. The present review will highlight these alterations of ghrelin in anorexia and discuss possible treatment strategies targeting ghrelin signaling. Lastly, gaps in knowledge will be mentioned to foster future research."
"['Berner LA', 'Brown TA', 'Lavender JM', 'Lopez E', 'Wierenga CE', 'Kaye WH.']",Neuroendocrinology of reward in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: Beyond leptin and ghrelin.,Mol Cell Endocrinol,"The pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are still poorly understood, but psychobiological models have proposed a key role for disturbances in the neuroendocrines that signal hunger and satiety and maintain energy homeostasis. Mounting evidence suggests that many neuroendocrines involved in the regulation of homeostasis and body weight also play integral roles in food reward valuation and learning via their interactions with the mesolimbic dopamine system. Neuroimaging data have associated altered brain reward responses in this system with the dietary restriction and binge eating and purging characteristic of AN and BN. Thus, neuroendocrine dysfunction may contribute to or perpetuate eating disorder symptoms via effects on reward circuitry. This narrative review focuses on reward-related neuroendocrines that are altered in eating disorder populations, including peptide YY, insulin, stress and gonadal hormones, and orexins. We provide an overview of the animal and human literature implicating these neuroendocrines in dopaminergic reward processes and discuss their potential relevance to eating disorder symptomatology and treatment."
['Haleem DJ.'],Improving therapeutics in anorexia nervosa with tryptophan.,Life Sci,"A growing body of evidence suggests that our diet is an important contributing factor in the development, management and prevention of a number of psychiatric illnesses. Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, is the sole precursor of neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin). Administration of tryptophan can boost serotonin neurotransmission to produce therapeutically important effects in serotonin deficiency disorders. Anorexia nervosa (AN) an eating disorder associated with high levels of psychiatric comorbidity including psychosis, hyperactivity, depression and anxiety has highest lethality of all psychiatric illnesses. Evidence suggests that excessive dieting and food restriction can decrease brain tryptophan and serotonin in AN patients to precipitate depression, psychosis and hyperactivity. There are currently no FDA approved pharmacological treatments available for AN patients; antidepressants and antipsychotics, largely used to treat associated psychiatric comorbidities are also not very effective. The aim of this non-systematic review article is to evaluate and document a potential importance of tryptophan supplementation in improving therapeutics in AN patients."
"['Gabriel T', 'Paul S', 'Berger A', 'Massoubre C.']",Anorexia Nervosa and Autism Spectrum Disorders: Future Hopes Linked to Mucosal Immunity.,Neuroimmunomodulation,"Mental health is becoming a public health priority worldwide. Anorexia nervosa and autism spectrum disorders are 2 important types of childhood disorders with a bad prognosis. They share cognitive impairments and, in both cases, the microbiota appears to be a crucial factor. Alteration of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is an appealing hypothesis to define new pathophysiological mechanisms. Mucosal immunity plays a key role between the microbiota and the brain. The mucosal immune system receives and integrates messages from the intestinal microenvironment and the microbiota and then transmits the information to the nervous system. Abnormalities in this sensorial system may be involved in the natural history of mental diseases and might play a role in their maintenance. This review aims to highlight data about the relationship between intestinal mucosal immunity and these disorders. We show that shared cognitive impairments could be found in these 2 disorders, which both present dysbiosis. This literature review provides details on the immune status of anorexic and autistic patients, with a focus on intestinal mucosal factors. Finally, we suggest future research hypotheses that seem important for understanding the implication of the gut-brain-axis in psychiatric diseases."
"['Monteleone AM', 'Castellini G', 'Volpe U', 'Ricca V', 'Lelli L', 'Monteleone P', 'Maj M.']",Neuroendocrinology and brain imaging of reward in eating disorders: A possible key to the treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,"Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are severe eating disorders whose etiopathogenesis is still unknown. Clinical features suggest that eating disorders may develop as reward-dependent syndromes, since eating less food is perceived as rewarding in anorexia nervosa while consumption of large amounts of food during binge episodes in bulimia nervosa aims at reducing the patient's negative emotional states. Therefore, brain reward mechanisms have been a major focus of research in the attempt to contribute to the comprehension of the pathophysiology of these disorders. Structural brain imaging data provided the evidence that brain reward circuits may be altered in patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Similarly, functional brain imaging studies exploring the activation of brain reward circuits by food stimuli as well as by stimuli recognized to be potentially rewarding for eating disordered patients, such as body image cues or stimuli related to food deprivation and physical hyperactivity, showed several dysfunctions in ED patients. Moreover, very recently, it has been demonstrated that some of the biochemical homeostatic modulators of eating behavior are also implicated in the regulation of food-related and non-food-related reward, representing a possible link between the aberrant behaviors of ED subjects and their hypothesized deranged reward processes. In particular, changes in leptin and ghrelin occur in patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa and have been suggested to represent not only homeostatic adaptations to an altered energy balance but to contribute also to the acquisition and/or maintenance of persistent starvation, binge eating and physical hyperactivity, which are potentially rewarding for ED patients. On the basis of such findings new pathogenetic models of EDs have been proposed, and these models may provide new theoretical basis for the development of innovative treatment strategies, either psychological and pharmacological, with the aim to improve the outcomes of so severe disabling disorders."

Using genome-wide methods, recent studies have associated many genes with the disorder. We characterized these genes by projecting them into reference transcriptomic atlases of the prenatal and adult human brain to determine where these genes are expressed in fine detail. We found that genes from an induced stem cell study of anorexia nervosa cases are expressed at higher levels in the lateral parabrachial nucleus. Although weaker, expression enrichment of the adult lateral parabrachial is also found with genes from independent genetic studies. Candidate causal genes from the largest genetic study of anorexia nervosa to date were enriched for expression in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. We also found an enrichment of anorexia nervosa associated genes in the adult and fetal raphe and ventral tegmental areas. Motivated by enrichment of these feeding circuits, we tested if these genes respond to fasting in mice hypothalami, which highlighted the differential expression of Rps26 and Dalrd3. This work improves our understanding of the neurobiology of anorexia nervosa by suggesting disturbances in subcortical appetitive circuits."
"['Kaye WH', 'Fudge JL', 'Paulus M.']",New insights into symptoms and neurocircuit function of anorexia nervosa.,Nat Rev Neurosci,"Individuals with anorexia nervosa have a relentless preoccupation with dieting and weight loss that results in severe emaciation and sometimes death. It is controversial whether such symptoms are secondary to psychosocial influences, are a consequence of obsessions and anxiety or reflect a primary disturbance of brain appetitive circuits. New brain imaging technology provides insights into ventral and dorsal neural circuit dysfunction - perhaps related to altered serotonin and dopamine metabolism - that contributes to the puzzling symptoms found in people with eating disorders. For example, altered insula activity could explain interoceptive dysfunction, and altered striatal activity might shed light on altered reward modulation in people with anorexia nervosa."
"['Herpertz-Dahlmann B', 'Seitz J', 'Baines J.']",Food matters: how the microbiome and gut-brain interaction might impact the development and course of anorexia nervosa.,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is one of the most common chronic illnesses in female adolescents and exhibits the highest mortality risk of all psychiatric disorders. Evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological interventions is weak. Mounting data indicate that the gut microbiome interacts with the central nervous system and the immune system by neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, neurotrophic and neuroinflammatory afferent and efferent pathways. There is growing evidence that the gut microbiota influences weight regulation and psychopathology, such as anxiety and depression. This article reviews how the gut-brain interaction may impact the development and course of AN. A ""leaky gut"", characterized by antigens traversing the intestinal wall, was demonstrated in an animal model of AN, and could underlie the low-grade inflammation and increased risk of autoimmune diseases found in AN. Moreover, starvation has a substantial impact on the gut microbiome, and diets used for re-nutrition based on animal products may support the growth of bacteria capable of triggering inflammation. As there is currently no empirically derived agreement on therapeutic re-nourishment in AN, this review discusses how consideration of gut-brain interactions may be important for treatment regarding the determination of target weight, rapidity of weight gain, refeeding methods and composition of the diet which might all be of importance to improve long-term outcome of one of the most chronic psychiatric disorders of adolescence."
"['Rowland NE', 'Atalayer D', 'Cervantez MR', 'Minaya DM', 'Splane EC.']",Cost-based anorexia: A novel framework to model anorexia nervosa.,Appetite,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder that is thought to emerge through biological predisposition(s) within sociocultural context(s). Practical and ethical concerns limit study of the etiology of this disorder in humans, and in particular the biological aspects. Laboratory animal models have a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the neurobiological, physiological and behavioral aspects of this disorder, and developing new treatment strategies. One shortcoming of animal models, including activity based anorexia (ABA) in rodents, is that they cannot fully capture the contextual aspects of AN. In this article we discuss the merits of an alternate approach, cost-based anorexia (CBA). CBA is conceptually founded in behavioral economics and its magnitude is influenced by several relevant contextual aspects of feeding."
"['Aurigemma NC', 'Koltun KJ', 'VanEvery H', 'Rogers CJ', 'De Souza MJ.']",Linking the Gut Microbiota to Bone Health in Anorexia Nervosa.,Curr Osteoporos Rep,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The purpose of this review is to examine the anorexia nervosa-microbiota-bone relationship, offering a compilation of the relevant human and animal studies that may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of potential mechanisms involved.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Recent studies have implicated fermentation by-products of the gut microbiota in bone metabolism. Compromised bone health often accompanies anorexia nervosa due to energy deficiency and hypoestrogenism. The gut microbiome has been implicated as a link between these conditions and impaired bone growth phenotypes. Current research supports decrements in Firmicutes and short-chain fatty acids with increases in Methanobrevibacter smithii and Proteobacteria in anorexia nervosa. A potential mechanism for microbiome-regulated bone growth is through modulation of insulin-like growth factor-1. Future research should aim to examine short-chain fatty acids, probiotics, and prebiotics as alternative therapies to treat low bone density in anorexia nervosa."
"['Fazeli PK', 'Klibanski A.']",The paradox of marrow adipose tissue in anorexia nervosa.,Bone,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by inappropriate nutrient intake resulting in low body weight. Multiple hormonal adaptations facilitate decreased energy expenditure in this state of caloric deprivation including non-thyroidal illness syndrome, growth hormone resistance, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Although these hormonal adaptations confer a survival advantage during periods of negative energy balance, they contribute to the long-term medical complications associated with AN, the most common of which is significant bone loss and an increased risk of fracture. In recent years, marrow adipose tissue (MAT) has emerged as an important potential determinant of the low bone mass state characteristic of AN. Unlike subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue depots which are low in AN, MAT levels are paradoxically elevated and are inversely associated with BMD. In this review, we discuss what is known about MAT in AN and the proposed hormonal determinants of this adipose tissue depot."
"['Murray SB', 'Strober M', 'Craske MG', 'Griffiths S', 'Levinson CA', 'Strigo IA.']",Fear as a translational mechanism in the psychopathology of anorexia nervosa.,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an often chronic and potentially lethal psychiatric disorder, for which the precise etiology remains elusive. While current treatment outcomes are modest at best, it is thought that the identification of translational mechanisms driving the psychopathology of AN will assist in the development and optimization of novel treatments. AN is a disorder characterized by fear and avoidance, hypervigilant scrutiny of one's body, and an unnatural fear of weight gain. Moreover, a suite of anxious traits and regimentation of behavior are atypically common well in advance of the onset of restrictive eating in those with AN. Here we consider the promise of shedding light on causal mechanisms of AN by interrogating the role of fear-related learning, deficits in discriminating safety cues, and extinction of acquired fear. We offer a translational rationale for this line of inquiry, and discuss the clinical implications of considering fear as a translational mechanism in the psychopathology of AN."
"['Himmerich H', 'Treasure J.']",Psychopharmacological advances in eating disorders.,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,"Anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are the primary eating disorders (EDs). The only psychopharmacological treatment options for EDs with approval in some countries include fluoxetine for BN and lisdexamfetamine for BED. Given the high comorbidity and genetic correlations with other psychiatric disorders, it seems possible that novel medications for these conditions might also be effective in EDs. Areas covered: The current scientific literature has increased our understanding of how medication could be beneficial for patients with EDs on a molecular, functional and behavioral level. On the basis of theoretical considerations about neurotransmitters, hormones and neural circuits, possible drug targets for the treatment of EDs may include signal molecules and receptors of the self-regulatory system such as serotonin, norepinephrine and glutamate, the hedonic system including opioids, cannabinoids and dopamine and the hypothalamic homeostatic system including histamine, ghrelin, leptin, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide-1. Expert commentary: The latest research points to an involvement of both the immune and the metabolic systems in the pathophysiology of EDs and highlights the importance of the microbiome. Therefore, the next few years may unveil drug targets for EDs not just inside and outside of the brain, but possibly even outside of the human body."
"['Foldi CJ', 'Milton LK', 'Oldfield BJ.']",A focus on reward in anorexia nervosa through the lens of the activity-based anorexia rodent model.,J Neuroendocrinol,"Patients suffering anorexia nervosa (AN) become anhedonic, unable or unwilling to derive normal pleasures and tend to avoid rewarding outcomes, most profoundly in food intake. The activity-based anorexia model recapitulates many of the pathophysiological and behavioural hallmarks of the human condition, including a reduction in food intake, excessive exercise, dramatic weight loss, loss of reproductive cycles, hypothermia and anhedonia, and therefore it allows investigation into the underlying neurobiology of anorexia nervosa. The use of this model has directed attention to disruptions in central reward neurocircuitry, which may contribute to disease susceptibility. The purpose of this review is to demonstrate the utility of this unique model to provide insight into the mechanisms of reward relevant to feeding and weight loss, which may ultimately help to unravel the neurobiology of anorexia nervosa and, in a broader sense, the foundation of reward-based feeding."
['Young JK.'],Anorexia nervosa and estrogen: current status of the hypothesis.,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,"Anorexia nervosa occurs predominantly in young women. Also, recent data suggest that a heritable, genetic defect may contribute to this feeding disorder. These observations support the hypothesis that an inherited, abnormal response of the brain to rising levels of estrogens at puberty may contribute to the symptoms of weight loss in anorexia. To evaluate the merits of this hypothesis, the current literature on feeding depression by estrogens in anorexic patients and possible genetic or developmental mechanisms that could alter brain responsiveness to estrogens are reviewed. It is concluded that a number of specific biochemical or developmental pathways-abnormalities in the classical or membrane-bound forms of estrogen receptors, in co-activators for estrogen, in thyroxine receptors, in steroid metabolizing enzymes, in quantitative trait loci, in perinatal androgenization, and in processes of puberty-could converge to produce an abnormal response to estrogen and the onset of anorexia nervosa."
['Scolnick B.'],Ketogenic diet and anorexia nervosa.,Med Hypotheses,"This hypothesis suggest that starvation-induced ketosis, which leads to a fundamental biochemical change in the metabolic fuel supply of the brain, is uniquely anxiolytic and rewarding to patients prone to AN. Ketosis can easily be replicated by a unique diet marked by high fat, moderate protein, and very low carbohydrate. This diet, known as a ketogenic diet (KGD) mimics starvation, thus allowing the patient to experience the anxiolytic state of ketosis, and yet avoid the morbidity of starvation."
"['Ramoz N', 'Versini A', 'Gorwood P.']",Anorexia nervosa and estrogen receptors.,Vitam Horm,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic psychiatric disorder with a high prevalence of 0.6% and the highest mortality rates among psychiatric diseases, around 10%, mostly due to undernutrition and suicide. AN is characterized by physiological features with a body mass index less than 17.5 kg/m(2), low bone mineral density and amenorrhea, psychological symptoms with a distortion of image body, and behavioral abnormalities. Estrogen molecules and estrogen biological pathway are clearly involved in food intake and body weight in animals and humans. Further, hypoestrogenism has been demonstrated in AN patients and convergent evidence involves the estrogen pathway in the development of AN. AN presents a high heritability and polymorphisms in genes coding the estrogen receptors alpha and beta have been found significantly associated with the disorder. This chapter shows the implication of estrogens in AN and suggests investigation to develop future pharmacological treatments for anorexia."

To address this, germ-free mice were reconstituted with the microbiota of four patients with restricting-type AN (gAN mice) and four healthy control individuals (gHC mice). The effects of gut microbes on weight gain and behavioral characteristics were examined. Fecal microbial profiles in recipient gnotobiotic mice were clustered with those of the human donors. Compared with gHC mice, gAN mice showed a decrease in body weight gain, concomitant with reduced food intake. Food efficiency ratio (body weight gain/food intake) was also significantly lower in gAN mice than in gHC mice, suggesting that decreased appetite as well as the capacity to convert ingested food to unit of body substance may contribute to poor weight gain. Both anxiety-related behavior measured by open-field tests and compulsive behavior measured by a marble-burying test were increased only in gAN mice but not in gHC mice. Serotonin levels in the brain stem of gAN mice were lower than those in the brain stem of gHC mice. Moreover, the genus Bacteroides showed the highest correlation with the number of buried marbles among all genera identified. Administration of Bacteroides vulgatus reversed compulsive behavior but failed to exert any substantial effect on body weight. Collectively, these results indicate that AN-specific dysbiosis may contribute to both poor weight gain and mental disorders in patients with AN."
"['Seitz J', 'Konrad K', 'Herpertz-Dahlmann B.']","Extend, Pathomechanism and Clinical Consequences of Brain Volume Changes in Anorexia Nervosa.",Curr Neuropharmacol,"Introduction:
        
      
      Brain volume deficits of grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) are often found in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). However, until recently, little was known about the influencing factors of these brain volume alterations, nor their exact quantification and rehabilitation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This review addresses these open questions and further explores what is now known about the underlying pathobiology and the clinical consequences including human studies as well as animal studies mimicking anorexia nervosa in rodents.
    


          Results:
        
      
      GM was reduced by 3.7% in adults and 7.6% in adolescents with AN. WM was reduced on average 2.2% in adult patients and 3.2% in adolescents. Most volume deficits in adults are reversible after long-term recovery; for adolescents, data are less clear. The main influencing factors for GM were absolute lowest weight at admission and illness duration. Cerebellar and WM reductions at admission predicted clinical outcome at one year follow-up. New studies found GABA receptor changes in GM and astrocyte loss in both GM and WM, as well as a possible role for oestrogen deficit. All three could partly explain clinical symptoms of anxiety, rigidity and learning impairments in patients with AN.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Brain volume deficits in AN seem to play a causal role in the course and the prognosis of AN. A better understanding of these brain changes could lead to more targeted therapies for patients with AN, including astrocyte-directed approaches."
"['Lee WC', 'Guntur AR', 'Long F', 'Rosen CJ.']",Energy Metabolism of the Osteoblast: Implications for Osteoporosis.,Endocr Rev,"Osteoblasts, the bone-forming cells of the remodeling unit, are essential for growth and maintenance of the skeleton. Clinical disorders of substrate availability (e.g., diabetes mellitus, anorexia nervosa, and aging) cause osteoblast dysfunction, ultimately leading to skeletal fragility and osteoporotic fractures. Conversely, anabolic treatments for osteoporosis enhance the work of the osteoblast by altering osteoblast metabolism. Emerging evidence supports glycolysis as the major metabolic pathway to meet ATP demand during osteoblast differentiation. Glut1 and Glut3 are the principal transporters of glucose in osteoblasts, although Glut4 has also been implicated. Wnt signaling induces osteoblast differentiation and activates glycolysis through mammalian target of rapamycin, whereas parathyroid hormone stimulates glycolysis through induction of insulin-like growth factor-I. Glutamine is an alternate fuel source for osteogenesis via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acids can be metabolized to generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation although temporal specificity has not been established. More studies with new model systems are needed to fully understand how the osteoblast utilizes fuel substrates in health and disease and how that impacts metabolic bone diseases."
"['Clarke TK', 'Weiss AR', 'Berrettini WH.']",The genetics of anorexia nervosa.,Clin Pharmacol Ther,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a disease defined by inappropriate weight loss and maintenance of body weight <85% of that expected for weight and height; it is most common in adolescent women aged 15-19 years. Numerous studies have highlighted the familial aggregation of the disease, suggesting a significant genetic component to its etiology. The purpose of this review is to discuss the different fields of genetic research--both in humans and animals--that have contributed to the understanding of this complex disorder. Candidate gene studies focusing on genes involved in the hypothalamic control of appetite and energy regulation have found genetic risk variants that increase risk for AN. A recent genome-wide association study has highlighted novel loci for further investigation in AN. Animal models and epigenetic studies are also considered; the most recent advances in each field and their contributions to the understanding of AN are emphasized."
"['Guarda AS', 'Schreyer CC', 'Boersma GJ', 'Tamashiro KL', 'Moran TH.']","Anorexia nervosa as a motivated behavior: Relevance of anxiety, stress, fear and learning.",Physiol Behav,"The high comorbidity between anorexia nervosa (AN) and anxiety disorders is well recognized. AN is a motivated behavioral disorder in which habit formation is likely to contribute to the persistence of abnormal eating and exercise behaviors. Secondary alterations in brain circuitry underlying the reward value of food and exercise, along with disturbances in neuroendocrine hunger and satiety signaling arising from starvation and excessive exercise, are likely contributors to the maintenance of anorectic behaviors in genetically vulnerable individuals. The potential role of fear conditioning in facilitating onset of AN, or of impaired fear extinction in contributing to the high relapse rates observed following weight restoration, is of interest. Evidence from animal models of anxiety and human laboratory studies indicate that low estrogen impairs fear extinction. Low estradiol levels in AN may therefore play a role in perpetuating fear of food and fat in recently weight restored patients. Translational models including the activity based anorexia (ABA) rodent model of AN, and neuroimaging studies of fear extinction and conditioning, could help clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms and neurocircuitry involved in food avoidance behaviors in AN. Moreover, the adaptation of novel treatment interventions with efficacy in anxiety disorders may contribute to the development of new treatments for this impairing disorder."
"['Viltart O', 'Duriez P', 'Tolle V.']",Metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations to undernutrition in anorexia nervosa: from a clinical to a basic research point of view.,Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig,"The exact mechanisms linking metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations to undernutrition and the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (AN) are not fully understood. AN is a psychiatric disorder of complex etiology characterized by extreme starvation while the disease is progressing into a chronic state. Metabolic and endocrine alterations associated to this disorder are part of a powerful response to maintain whole body energy homeostasis. But these modifications may also contribute to associated neuropsychiatric symptoms (reward abnormalities, anxiety, depression) and thus participate to sustain the disease. The current review presents data with both a clinical and basic research point of view on the role of nutritional and energy sensors with neuroendocrine actions in the pathophysiology of the disease, as they modulate metabolic responses, reproductive functions, stress responses as well as physical activity. While clinical data present a full description of changes occurring in AN, animal models that integrate either spontaneous genetic mutations or experimentally-induced food restriction with hyperactivity and/or social stress recapitulate the main metabolic and endocrine alterations of AN and provide mechanistic information between undernutrition state and symptoms of the disease. Further progress on the central and peripheral mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of eating disorders partly relies on the development and/or refinement of existing animal models to include recently identified genetic traits and better mimic the complex and multifactorial dimensions of the disease."

Nowadays, it is a well-known spice that possesses worth pharmacological effects. However, some relevant articles have revealed negative impacts of licorice in health. By considering the great wishes in using herbal medicine, it is important to show adverse effects of herbal medicine in health. At present, there are misunderstandings toward the safety of herbal medicines. Herein, we gathered scientific research projects on the toxicity effects of licorice and glycyrrhizin to highlight their safety. In this regards, we categorized our findings about the toxicity effects of licorice and glycyrrhizin in acute, sub-acute, sub-chronic, and chronic states. Besides, we discussed on the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity of licorice and glycyrrhizin as well as their developmental toxicity. This review disclosed that G. glabra and glycyrrhizin salts are moderately toxic. They need to be used with caution during pregnancy. G. glabra and glycyrrhizin possess selective cytotoxic effects on cancerous cells. The most important side effects of licorice and glycyrrhizin are hypertension and hypokalemic-induced secondary disorders. Licorice side effects are increased by hypokalemia, prolonged gastrointestinal transient time, decreased type 2 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities, hypertension, anorexia nervosa, old age, and female sex.

['Scolnick B.'],Antihistamine agents and pitolisant might be useful for anorexia nervosa.,Med Hypotheses,"This hypothesis is that patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) demonstrate derangement in the histamine central nervous system. It might be possible to ameliorate these by careful use of histamine receptor antagonists targeting Histamine 1, 2, or 3 receptors. Histamine 3 receptors are exclusively present in the brain. Pitolisant is the only one agent currently available that targets these receptors. Pitolisant (brand name Wakix) was approved in the European Union, as a treatment for narcolepsy in March 2016."
"['Södersten P', 'Bergh C', 'Ammar A.']",Anorexia nervosa: towards a neurobiologically based therapy.,Eur J Pharmacol,"Eating disorders, i.e. anorexia and bulimia nervosa, are disorders of eating behavior and body weight regulation. Most likely because there are few, if any, effective treatments, eating disorders are considered to be chronic disorders interrupted only by intermittent periods of short-lived remission. The neurobiology of eating, most of which explores hypothalamic mechanisms, has had no influence on the treatment of eating disorders, with the exception of psychopharmacology. However, while most patients are treated with psychoactive drugs, there is no evidence that these are effective. This may be because pharmacological attempts so far have targeted the wrong symptoms. We review the symptomatology of anorexia and bulimia and the outcome of presently used interventions. Everybody agrees that outcome must improve and to attack this clinical problem, we suggest a neurobiologically plausible framework for how the disorders develop and how they are maintained and outline a method of treatment and its results."

      Studies conducted on the efficacy of fluoxetine in treating anorexia nervosa have conflicting results. Study design and methodology should be carefully evaluated.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Fluoxetine played a role in the reduction of symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression in anorexic patients. While psychotherapy, nutritional therapy, and behavioral therapy should be the mainstays of treatment, fluoxetine should be considered as an option to prevent relapse or to treat associated symptoms of anorexia nervosa following adequate weight restoration as a part of maintenance therapy and not as a primary or acute therapy. Although fluoxetine appears to be promising for the treatment of patients with anorexia nervosa, further studies need to be performed with a larger sample size and/or better design."
"['Shih PB', 'Morisseau C', 'Le T', 'Woodside B', 'German JB.']",Personalized polyunsaturated fatty acids as a potential adjunctive treatment for anorexia nervosa.,Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex psychiatric disorder with high morbidity and mortality rates. While many individuals make full recoveries, up to a third of patients develop a chronic, treatment-resistant form of the illness that leads to a premature death in 15-20% of those affected. There have been few advances in treatment, both in terms of psychological or pharmacologic treatment over the last 30 years. Food aversion is commonly cited by patients with AN as a barrier to normalizing eating and weight. Our group has a keen interest in examining factors that might allow this to be addressed, thus improving treatment outcomes through personalized dietary plans or nutritional supplementation related to underlying genetic status. We demonstrated that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)-derived bioactive lipids (eicosanoids) are implicated in not only the risk of AN, but also with its comorbid psychopathology. Of interest, the differential postprandial omega 6-derived eicosanoid shift observed in AN highlights the possibility that the metabolism of PUFAs is an important mechanism underlying the profound food version, contributing to pathological food restriction in AN. A concise knowledge of the relationships among PUFAs, eicosanoids, and AN clinical course and psychopathology could be the key to developing personalized nutritional rehabilitative treatments for those suffering from AN. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on PUFAs in AN. We also selectively reviewed the clinical benefits PUFA treatments exert in other psychiatric diseases, on weight and appetite regulation, and for resolution of inflammation, all of which are relevant in the disease course and outcome of AN. We propose that personalized PUFA formulation be developed and tested as a novel adjunctive treatment for patients with AN.

The identification of neural correlates and novel agents to transform treatment has become priority avenues for research. Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide whose emerging sphere of influence on mammalian behaviour and demonstrated impact on psychiatric illness suggest it may have potential in AN. In this paper, we undertake a targeted summary of the existing literature on OT research as it pertains to brain based behaviour and psychiatric dysfunction. Then, we conduct a systematic review of OT in AN. Papers that addressed any aspect of the OT system in AN were examined. The existing literature, although limited and based on small sample sizes, suggests a derangement of the OT system in AN that may normalise upon recovery. Preliminary pilot data from unpublished studies suggest a potential effect of OT administration on eating-related indices."
['Haleem DJ.'],Serotonin neurotransmission in anorexia nervosa.,Behav Pharmacol,"Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) show extreme dieting weight loss, hyperactivity, depression/anxiety, self-control, and behavioral impulsivity. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) is involved in almost all the behavioral changes observed in AN patients. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute toward the pathogenesis of AN. It is a frequent disorder among adolescent girls and young women and starts as an attempt to lose weight to look beautiful and attractive. Failure to see the turning point when fasting becomes unreasonable leads to malnutrition and AN. Tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin and an essential amino acid, is only available in the diet. It is therefore likely that excessive diet restriction and malnutrition decrease brain serotonin stores because the precursor is less available to the rate-limiting enzyme of 5-HT biosynthesis, which normally exists unsaturated with its substrate. Evidence shows that diet restriction-induced exaggerated feedback control over 5-HT synthesis and the smaller availability of tryptophan decreases serotonin neurotransmission at postsynaptic sites, leading to hyperactivity, depression, and behavioral impulsivity. A compensatory upregulation of postsynaptic 5-HT-1A receptors and hypophagic serotonin receptors may be involved in anxiety and suppression of appetite. It is suggested that tryptophan supplementation may improve pharmacotherapy in AN."

The present paper suggests that certain psychosocial and endocrinological factors may interact to provide the setting conditions for the syndrome. Finally, it is suggested that a dual therapeutic approach is required in that the syndrome needs to be treated both physiologically and psychologically to prevent relapse."

      The role of the gut microbiota in Anorexia Nervosa (AN) has long been neglected by researchers, although the fact that the former is known to play an important role in health, disease and weight regulation. Cycles of overweight and underweight due to natural states of starvation and refeeding are normal in many vertebrates in their ecological niches.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this review was to compare the similarities and differences of the gut microbiota in eating disorders with conditions of fasting and refeeding in other vertebrates.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed and Web of Science to find all relevant studies examining the gut microbiota in eating disorders and different states of fasting in vertebrates for this narrative review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Gut microbiota appears to differ in AN versus normal-weight individuals. Induced fasting conditions in other vertebrates resulted in heterogeneous effects on gut microbiota with respect to their richness, diversity and community structures. The findings for hibernating animals were generally consistent. A decrease in microbial richness and diversity was observed in the hibernating animal compared to the active animal, and the community structures were linked to these conditions. Some similarities and differences between AN and different states of fasting in other vertebrates were found.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The complexity of the relationship between fasting and gut microbiota is difficult to interprete. A deeper biological understanding is necessary to identify promising approaches for the modulation of the AN gut microbiota to support established psychotherapies."
"['Kontis D', 'Theochari E.']",Dopamine in anorexia nervosa: a systematic review.,Behav Pharmacol,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic relapsing psychiatric disorder with a largely unknown pathophysiology. Dopamine has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder by preclinical and clinical evidence. Preclinical studies have examined two main characteristics of AN: reduction in food intake (diet restriction) and hyperactivity. Diet restriction has been associated with reduced dopamine levels in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and the dorsal striatum. Animal hyperactivity following diet restriction has been linked to increased dopamine in the hypothalamus. Increased dopamine in the nucleus accumbens was associated with food administration, but not food expectation. Tyrosine and dopaminergic antagonists normalized anorexia-like behaviors in animal models of AN, but did not restore body weight. Clinical studies on the etiology of AN have produced contradictory findings. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of dopamine and its metabolites have been reported to be decreased or normal under conditions of low weight, whereas they tended to normalize when the weight was restored. Plasma and urinary levels of dopamine and its metabolites have been found to be normal, increased, and decreased. Neuroendocrine studies suggest that dopaminergic neurotransmission is increased in AN. However, recent neuroimaging studies lend support to the increase in binding of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum, which favors the opposite theory that intrasynaptic dopamine is indeed decreased. Genetic studies implicate dopamine D2 receptors, the dopamine transporter, and the enzyme COMT. There are promising results with respect to the use of atypical antipsychotics against symptoms of AN beyond weight gain, but further trials are required."

To this aim, we review the effects of food restriction and starvation in humans. It is suggested that body weight remains stable and relatively low when the access to food requires a considerable amount of physical activity. In this condition, the human homeostatic phenotype, body fat content is also low and as a consequence, the synthesis and release of brain neurotransmitters are modified. As an example, the role of neuropeptide Y is analyzed in rat models of this state. It is suggested that the normal behavioral role of neuropeptide Y is to facilitate the search for food and switch attention from sexual stimuli to food. Descriptive neuroendocrine studies on patients with anorexia nervosa have not contributed to the management of the patients and the few studies in which hormones have been administered have, at best, reversed an endocrine consequence secondary to starvation. In a modified framework for understanding the etiology and treatment of anorexia nervosa it is suggested that the condition emerges because neural mechanisms of reward and attention are engaged. The neural neuropeptide Y receptor system may be involved in the maintenance of the behavior of eating disorder patients because the localization of these receptors overlaps with the neural systems engaged in cue-conditioned eating in limbic and cortical areas. The eating behavior of patients with anorexia nervosa, and other eating disorders as well, is viewed as a cause of the psychological changes of the patients. Patients are trained to re-learn normal eating habits using external support and as they do, their symptoms, including the psychological symptoms, dissolve."

Feeding behavior is highly complex, and is controlled by many psychological, physiological, biochemical, and immunological factors. The aim of this review is to clarify the involvement of fatty acids in eating disorders such as anorexia and binge eating disorder. The review will describe the modified fatty acid profile observed in individuals with anorexia or binge eating disorder, and discuss on what factors fatty acids can exert beneficial effects. In addition, the differences and similarities between anorexia and binge eating disorder will be discussed. We suggest that beneficial effects of essential fatty acids on both anorexia and binge eating disorder can be explained by the stabilizing effect of those fatty acids on the neuronal membrane fluidity index."

During starvation, autophagy is induced in numerous organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, and promotes survival by supplying nutrients and energy. In the early neonatal period, when transplacental nutrients supply is interrupted, starvation-induced autophagy is crucial for neonates' survival. In adult animals, autophagy provides amino acids and participates in glucose metabolism following starvation. In patients with anorexia nervosa, autophagy appears initially protective, allowing cells to copes with nutrient deprivation. However, when starvation is critically prolonged and when body mass index reaches 13 kg/m(2) or lower, acute liver insufficiency occurs with features of autophagic cell death, which can be observed by electron microscopy analysis of liver biopsy samples. In acetaminophen overdose, a classic cause of severe liver injury, autophagy is induced as a protective mechanism. Pharmacological enhancement of autophagy protects against acetaminophen-induced necrosis. Autophagy is also activated as a rescue mechanism in response to Efavirenz-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. However, Efavirenz overdose blocks autophagy leading to liver cell death. In conclusion, in acute liver injury, autophagy appears as a protective mechanism that can be however blocked or overwhelmed."

      Anorexia nervosa is a widely prevalent eating disorder that o en leads to life-threatening complications. Since it mostly concerns females, many authors have focused on studying the reproductive system in anorexic women. Recently discovered telocytes may give a new insight into the pathophysiology of gynecological complications in these patients.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      We adopted an animal model of anorexia nervosa induced by voluntary physical activity. Sixteen female Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control and activity-based anorexia. When the weight loss of activity-based anorexia (ABA) rats reached 25% animals were euthanized. Size and weight measurements as well as histopathological analysis of the reproductive organs were performed. Additionally, we used immunohistochemical staining for detection of telocytes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Telocytes were identified in uteri of anorectic rats but no differences were observed when compared to the control group. Nevertheless, in the ABA group the weight of the uteri and the number of follicles in the ovaries decreased significantly.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our rat model of anorexia nervosa mimics the effects of this eating disorder that occur in the female reproductive system since we reported ovarian dysfunction and uterine involution in the experimental animals. It supports its potential role in the further studies of anorexia pathophysiology and treatment possibilities."
"['Zhang L', 'Yagi M', 'Herzog H.']",The role of NPY and ghrelin in anorexia nervosa.,Curr Pharm Des,"Complex mechanisms have evolved that control feeding and energy homeostasis in mammals. Centrally, particularly in the hypothalamus, numerous neurotransmitters have been identified that regulate appetite and energy homeostasis. On the other hand, hormones released from the gut signal states of hunger and satiety to the brain. From the large number of players involved in this interplay, peptides from the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family are unique, with the predominantly neuronally expressed NPY being one of the most strongly stimulating agents for food intake while its two other closely related family members peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) released from the gut induce satiety. Another major player in this circuitry is ghrelin, which is released from the stomach and is the only known hormone that signals hunger to the brain. It is doing this by stimulating hypothalamic NPY production and release, subsequently leading to increased appetite and feeding behaviour. Deregulation of these processes can lead to either the development of obesity or the other extreme, anorexia. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent literature on NPY and ghrelin and its involvement in anorexia nervosa."

Reported GI disturbances in BN include increased gastric capacity, diminished gastric relaxation, delayed gastric emptying, diminished release of cholecystokinin (CCK) and abnormalities of enteric autonomic function, all of which may play a role in perpetuation of the syndrome.

Risk factors for developing an ED include personality traits, family environment, gender, age, ethnicity, and culture.

Our objective was to explore evolutionary theories of EDs to provide a new perspective on research into novel biological mechanisms and genetic causes of EDs. We developed a framework that explains the possible interactions between genetic risk and cultural influences in the development of ED. The framework includes three genetic predisposition categories (people with mainly AN restrictive gene variants, people with mainly BED variants, and people with gene variants predisposing to both diseases) and a binary variable of either the presence or absence of pressure to be thin. We propose novel theories to explain the overlapping characteristics of the subtypes of AN (binge/purge and restrictive), BN, and BED. For instance, mutations/structural gene variants in the same gene causing opposite effects or mutations in nearby genes resulting in partial disequilibrium for the genes causing AN (restrictive) and BED may explain the overlap of phenotypes seen in AN (binge/purge)."

The vulnerability component of anorexia nervosa that can be attributed to genetic influences has been estimated from twin studies to be around 70%. Despite this, few genetic studies have been performed testing the role of candidate genes which code for proteins potentially implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of the disorder. In this review, genes encoding components of the dopamine, serotonin, opiate, and noradrenaline systems are assessed for their role in anorexia nervosa.

Some of these are almost exclusively secreted by adipose tissue. Leptin, adiponectin and resistin are specific fat-derived hormones that affect fuel homeostasis and insulin action, and may also be involved in hematopoiesis and immune functions. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by chronic self-starvation and severe weight loss, mainly at the expense of adipose tissue. Starvation-induced depletion of fat stores is accompanied by alterations of circulating adipocytokines. Plasma leptin and likely resistin levels are decreased in anorectic patients, while plasma adiponectin levels are increased. These alterations may have potential repercussions in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa. Thus, low leptin and high adiponectin may separately or in concert contribute to altered hematopoiesis and immunity, enhanced insulin sensitivity, neuroendocrine disturbances or osteopenia in anorexia nervosa."
['Keating C.'],Theoretical perspective on anorexia nervosa: the conflict of reward.,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,"This theoretical proposal presents a revised framework for the role of reward in anorexia nervosa (AN). AN is associated with a fear of weight gain and refusal to maintain a minimally normal body weight. Up to 80% of patients engage in excessive exercise, in addition to self-starvation, to reduce their body weight. Anhedonia is the reduced ability to experience reward and is considered a feature of AN. Reward has been linked to reduced food intake and excessive exercise. This proposal portends that whilst patients' pathological behaviors are in the first instance, rewarding, they become reinforced in a manner that becomes pathological, even punishing. Patients, however, may not recognize that they are contaminating aspects of reward with punishment, which may impair their ability to regulate their behaviors. Neural overlap between circuits that process reward and those that process punishment, is proposed as a mechanism in AN, in addition to which the anterior cingulate cortex, may represent a key locus for reward-contamination."

While an effective pharmacotherapy is lacking, it is hypothesized that the progesterone and type II glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone (RU486) might be useful, as it is well known that the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) is activated in AN. Even if secondary to the eating disorder, an active HPA axis may contribute to maintaining the neuroendocrine, emotional and behavioral effects observed in AN. More specifically, it is suggested that the HPA axis interacts with limbic structures, including the insular and prefrontal cortices, to uphold the changes in interoceptive and emotional awareness seen in AN. As such, it is proposed that mifepristone (RU486) reverses these effects by acting on these limbic regions. In conclusion, the theoretical efficacy of mifepristone (RU486) in improving symptoms of AN should be tested in randomized clinical trials."
"['Asarian L', 'Geary N.']",Sex differences in the physiology of eating.,Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis function fundamentally affects the physiology of eating. We review sex differences in the physiological and pathophysiological controls of amounts eaten in rats, mice, monkeys, and humans. These controls result from interactions among genetic effects, organizational effects of reproductive hormones (i.e., permanent early developmental effects), and activational effects of these hormones (i.e., effects dependent on hormone levels). Male-female sex differences in the physiology of eating involve both organizational and activational effects of androgens and estrogens. An activational effect of estrogens decreases eating 1) during the periovulatory period of the ovarian cycle in rats, mice, monkeys, and women and 2) tonically between puberty and reproductive senescence or ovariectomy in rats and monkeys, sometimes in mice, and possibly in women. Estrogens acting on estrogen receptor-α (ERα) in the caudal medial nucleus of the solitary tract appear to mediate these effects in rats. Androgens, prolactin, and other reproductive hormones also affect eating in rats. Sex differences in eating are mediated by alterations in orosensory capacity and hedonics, gastric mechanoreception, ghrelin, CCK, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon, insulin, amylin, apolipoprotein A-IV, fatty-acid oxidation, and leptin. The control of eating by central neurochemical signaling via serotonin, MSH, neuropeptide Y, Agouti-related peptide (AgRP), melanin-concentrating hormone, and dopamine is modulated by HPG function. Finally, sex differences in the physiology of eating may contribute to human obesity, anorexia nervosa, and binge eating. The variety and physiological importance of what has been learned so far warrant intensifying basic, translational, and clinical research on sex differences in eating."

The illness is characterized by intense fear of gaining weight, heightened anxiety, obstinate food restriction, often accompanied by excessive exercise, in spite of mounting hunger. The illness affects females nine times more often than males, suggesting an endocrine role in its etiology. Its relapse rate exceeds 25%, yet there are no accepted pharmacological treatments to prevent this. Here, we summarize studies from this laboratory that have used adolescent female rodents in activity-based anorexia (ABA), an animal model of anorexia nervosa, with the goal of identifying neurobiological underpinnings of this disease. We put forth a hypothesis that a GABAergic mechanism within the hippocampus is central to regulating an individual׳s anxiety which, in turn, strongly influences the individual׳s resilience/vulnerability to ABA. In particular, we propose that ionotropic GABAA receptors containing the subunits alpha4 and delta, are at play for exerting shunting inhibition upon hippocampal pyramidal neurons that become more excitable during ABA. Since these receptors confer insensitivity to benzodiazepines, this pharmacological profile of ABA fits with lack of report indicating efficacy of benzodiazepines in reducing the anxiety experienced by individuals with anorexia nervosa. The idea that the GABAergic system of the hippocampus regulates resilience/vulnerability to anorexia nervosa complements current opinions about the important roles of the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, striatum, gustatory pathways and feeding centers of the hypothalamus and of the neuromodulators, serotonin and dopamine, in the etiology of the disease.

      Despite the growing knowledge on the functional relationship between an altered endocannabinoid (eCB) system and development of anorexia nervosa (AN), to date no studies have investigated the central eCB tone in the activity-based anorexia (ABA) model that reproduces key aspects of human AN.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We measured levels of two major eCBs, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), those of two eCB-related lipids, oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) density in the brain of female ABA rats, focusing on areas involved in homeostatic and rewarding-related regulation of feeding behavior (i.e., prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudato putamen, amygdala, hippocampus and hypothalamus). Analysis was carried out also at the end of recovery from the ABA condition.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At the end of the ABA induction phase, 2-AG was significantly decreased in ABA rats in different brain areas but not in the caudato putamen. No changes were detected in AEA levels in any region, whereas the levels of OEA and PEA were decreased exclusively in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Furthermore, CB1R density was decreased in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus and in the lateral hypothalamus. After recovery, both 2-AG levels and CB1R density were partially normalized in some areas. In contrast, AEA levels became markedly reduced in all the analyzed areas.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      These data demonstrate an altered brain eCB tone in ABA rats, further supporting the involvement of an impaired eCB system in AN pathophysiology that may contribute to the maintenance of some symptomatic aspects of the disease."

This review presents a model of AN that ties together advances in our understanding of how leptin, serotonin, and hypogonadism are brought about in AN and how they influence bone mass. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a key regulator of satiety and mood. The primary disturbance in AN results from alterations in serotonin signaling. AN patients suffer from serotonergic hyperactivity of Htr1a-dependent pathways that causes dysphoric mood and promotes restrictive behavior. By limiting carbohydrate ingestion, anorexics decrease their serotonin levels. Reduced serotonergic signaling in turn suppresses appetite through Htr1a/2b, decreases dysphoric mood through Htr1a/2a, and activates the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) through Htr2c receptors in the ventromedial hypothalamus. Activation of the SNS decreases bone mass through β2-adrenergic signaling in osteoblasts. Additional topics reviewed here include osteoblastic feedback of metabolism in anorexia, mechanisms whereby dietary changes exacerbate bone loss, the role of caloric restriction and Sirt1 in bone metabolism, hypothalamic hypogonadism's effects on bone mass, and potential treatments."

The altered activity of neurotransmitters modulating patients' moods after the consumption of food and a disturbed responsiveness to enterohormones enhance affective-motivational and cognitive aspects which, in turn, impede the improvement of eating behaviors. An understanding of the mechanisms behind the factors affecting the maintenance of inappropriate eating attitudes may contribute to greater effectiveness in the treatment of anorexia nervosa."

In AN, there does not appear to be a generalised inability to experience reward. Rather, data suggest that a reluctance to gain weight leads to an aversive appraisal of food- and taste-related stimuli. As a result, cues compatible with this aberrant mode of thinking become rewarding for the individual. Evidence also suggests that attribution of motivational salience to such cues promotes anorectic behaviours. These findings are consistent with models in which interactions between cognition and reward are important in eliciting the anorectic ""habit"". A model is proposed which is consistent with elements of other theoretical frameworks, but differs in that its emphasis is towards neural overlaps between AN and addiction. It is consistent with AN being a reward-based learned behaviour in which aberrant cognitions related to eating and shape alter functioning of central reward systems. It proposes that the primary neural problem responsible for the development, maintenance, and treatment resistance is centred in the striatal reward system. This helps shift the emphasis of aetiological models towards reward processing, particularly in the context of illness-compatible cues. Furthermore, it suggests that continuing to explore the utility and valued nature of AN in the patient's life would be a useful inclusion in treatment and prevention models."

This review describes the basic neurobiology of feeding and hyperactivity seen in both ABA and AN, and compiles the research on the role that stress-response and reward pathways play in modulating the homeostatic drive to eat and to expend energy, which become dysfunctional in ABA and AN."
"['Treasure JL', 'Owen JB.']",Intriguing links between animal behavior and anorexia nervosa.,Int J Eat Disord,"Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this review is to examine the literature on possible animal models for anorexia nervosa.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The literature was searched using MedLine, PSYCHLIT, and CAB Abstracts using search items that included body composition, thin sow syndrome, and halothane gene. In addition, key workers in the field of animal husbandry and body composition were sent earlier drafts of the paper for comment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thin sow syndrome in pigs has some similarities to anorexia nervosa. Leanness and susceptibility to stress are associated in pigs with mutations of the ryanodine gene. Body composition in animals has a high heritability and various components of this overall composite trait are influenced to a major extent by polymorphism at specific gene loci.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Recent developments in understanding body composition in animals offer intriguing insights into anorexia nervosa and suggest several candidate genes which would be worthy of further examination."

The hyperactivity of patients with anorexia nervosa, however, is a main problem for recovery. This seemingly paradoxical reward of hyperactivity in anorexia nervosa is one of the main aspects in our framework for the neurobiological changes that may underlie the development of the disorder. Here, we focus on the neurobiological basis of hyperactivity and reward in both animals and humans suggesting that the mesolimbic dopamine and hypothalamic orexin neurons play central roles.

"['Schocken DD', 'Holloway JD', 'Powers PS.']",Weight loss and the heart. Effects of anorexia nervosa and starvation.,Arch Intern Med,"Anorexia nervosa is a common psychiatric disorder predominantly affecting young women, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, much involving the cardiovascular system. In contrast, protein-calorie malnutrition, while not strictly analogous to the protein-sparing characteristics often noted in anorexia nervosa, is a problem of global stature. Physiologic consequences of anorexia nervosa include rhythm disturbances, mitral valve prolapse, plus both systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction. Diminished exercise capacity occurs in both states, with marked blunting of the heart rate and blood pressure response. Congestive heart failure may appear, especially during refeeding. In addition to the myofibrillar destruction associated with protein-calorie malnutrition, hypophosphatemia, particularly when exacerbated by unrestricted glucose-rich refeedings or hyperalimentation, may be one additional cause of ventricular dysfunction. A high level of suspicion for cardiovascular complications is, therefore, warranted in the evaluation and therapy of weight loss conditions such as starvation and anorexia nervosa."

Therapeutic renourishment in AN is founded primarily on clinical opinion and guidelines, with a weak evidence base. Genetic factors do not fully account for the etiology of AN, and non-genetic factors that contribute to the onset and persistence of this disease warrant investigation. Compelling evidence that the intestinal microbiota regulates adiposity and metabolism, and more recently, anxiety behavior, provides a strong rationale for exploring the role of this complex microbial community in the onset, maintenance of, and recovery from AN. This review explores the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and AN and a potential role for this enteric microbial community as a therapy for this severe illness."
"['Giel K', 'Zipfel S', 'Hallschmid M.']",Oxytocin and Eating Disorders: A Narrative Review on Emerging Findings and Perspectives.,Curr Neuropharmacol,"Background:
        
      
      The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin regulates reproductive behavior and mother-infant interaction, and conclusive studies in humans indicate that oxytocin is also a potent modulator of psychosocial function. Pilot experiments have yielded first evidence that this neuropeptide moreover influences eating behavior.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We briefly summarize currently available studies on the involvement of the oxytocin system in the pathophysiology of eating disorders, as well as on the effects of oxytocin administration in patients with these disorders.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Brain administration of oxytocin in animals with normal weight, but also with diet-induced or genetically induced obesity, attenuates food intake and reduces body weight. In normal-weight and obese individuals, acute intranasal oxytocin delivery curbs calorie intake from main dishes and snacks. Such effects might converge with the poignant social and cognitive impact of oxytocin to also improve dysfunctional eating behavior in the therapeutic context. This assumption has received support in first studies showing that oxytocin might play a role in the disease process of anorexia nervosa. In contrast, respective experiments in patients with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are still scarce.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We propose a framework of oxytocin's role and its therapeutic potential in eating disorders that aims at integrating social and metabolic aspects of its pharmacological profile, and ponder perspectives and limitations of oxytocin use in the clinical setting."

      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided insight on how neural abnormalities are related to the symptomatology of the eating disorders (EDs): anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED). More specifically, an increasingly growing number of brain imaging studies has shed light on how functionally connected brain networks contribute not only to disturbed eating behavior, but also to transdiagnostic alterations in body/interoceptive perception, reward processing and executive functioning.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This narrative review aims to summarize recent advances in fMRI studies of patients with EDs by highlighting studies investigating network alterations that are shared across EDs.
    


          Results and conclusion:
        
      
      Findings on reward processing in both AN and BN patients point to the presence of altered sensitivity to salient food stimuli in striatal regions and to the possibility of hypothalamic inputs being overridden by top-down emotional-cognitive control regions. Additionally, innovative new lines of research suggest that increased activations in fronto-striatal circuits are strongly associated with the maintenance of restrictive eating habits in AN patients. Although significantly fewer studies have been carried out in patients with BN and BED, aberrant neural responses to both food cues and anticipated food receipt appear to occur in these populations. These altered responses, coupled with diminished recruitment of prefrontal cognitive control circuitry, are believed to contribute to the binge eating of palatable foods. Results from functional network connectivity studies are diverse, but findings tend to converge on indicating disrupted resting-state connectivity in executive networks, the default-mode network and the salience network across EDs."
"['Avena NM', 'Bocarsly ME.']","Dysregulation of brain reward systems in eating disorders: neurochemical information from animal models of binge eating, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia nervosa.",Neuropharmacology,"Food intake is mediated, in part, through brain pathways for motivation and reinforcement. Dysregulation of these pathways may underlay some of the behaviors exhibited by patients with eating disorders. Research using animal models of eating disorders has greatly contributed to the detailed study of potential brain mechanisms that many underlie the causes or consequences of aberrant eating behaviors. This review focuses on neurochemical evidence of reward-related brain dysfunctions obtained through animal models of binge eating, bulimia nervosa, or anorexia nervosa. The findings suggest that alterations in dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh) and opioid systems in reward-related brain areas occur in response to binge eating of palatable foods. Moreover, animal models of bulimia nervosa suggest that while bingeing on palatable food releases DA, purging attenuates the release of ACh that might otherwise signal satiety. Animal models of anorexia nervosa suggest that restricted access to food enhances the reinforcing effects of DA when the animal does eat. The activity-based anorexia model suggests alterations in mesolimbic DA and serotonin occur as a result of restricted eating coupled with excessive wheel running. These findings with animal models complement data obtained through neuroimaging and pharmacotherapy studies of clinical populations. Information on the neurochemical consequences of the behaviors associated with these eating disorders will be useful in understanding these complex disorders and may inform future therapeutic approaches, as discussed here.

"['Hebebrand J', 'Muller TD', 'Holtkamp K', 'Herpertz-Dahlmann B.']",The role of leptin in anorexia nervosa: clinical implications.,Mol Psychiatry,"Leptin is a hormone with pleiotropic functions affecting several tissues. Because leptin has a crucial role in the adaptation of an organism to semi-starvation, anorexia nervosa (AN) serves as a model disorder to elucidate the functional implications of hypoleptinaemia; vice versa, several symptoms in patients with this eating disorder are related to the low leptin levels, which are characteristic of acute AN. Weight gain in AN patients can induce relative hyperleptinaemia in comparison to controls matched for body mass index; circulating leptin concentrations in AN patients thus transverse from subnormal to supranormal levels within a few weeks. We review findings on leptin secretion in AN and focus on implications, particularly for the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, bone mineral density and physical hyperactivity. Undoubtedly, the elucidation of leptin's function as a trigger of diverse neuroendocrine adaptations to a restricted energy intake has substantially advanced our knowledge of the pathogenesis of distinct symptoms of AN, including amenorrhoea that represents one of the four diagnostic criteria. The fact that hypoleptinaemia can induce hyperactivity in a rat model for AN has led to a series of studies in AN patients, which support the notion that application of leptin to severely hyperactive patients might prove beneficial."
"['Södersten P', 'Bergh C.']",Recovering from anorexia nervosa by machine.,J Neuroendocrinol,"Any healthy person can develop anorexia nervosa. Prolonged dieting causes reversible endocrine changes that emerge to combat starvation, the main threat to survival.

However, a simple machine that provides feedback on how to eat can allow patients to escape from anorexia and restore their health."

Topics covered included fasting blood sugar concentrations; serum insulin concentrations, insulin receptor binding activity, insulin sensitivity, and insulin resistance; plasma ketone bodies and free fatty acids; glucose tolerance tests; growth hormone, cortisol, intestinal hormones, and norepinephrine. Metabolic changes reported in anorexia nervosa are similar to those found in human and animal studies of states of caloric and carbohydrate restriction. Restoration of normal body weight is associated with normalization of virtually all measures. It is concluded that published studies offer no conclusive evidence for a syndrome-specific impairment in carbohydrate metabolism in anorexia nervosa."
['Keating C.'],Sex differences precipitating anorexia nervosa in females: the estrogen paradox and a novel framework for targeting sex-specific neurocircuits and behavior.,Curr Top Behav Neurosci,"In anorexia nervosa (AN), reward contamination likely plays a significant role in maintenance of the illness. Reward contamination is a context in which patients' behaviors of self-starvation and excessive exercise, while initially rewarding, become aversive, even punishing; but patients may not recognize the punishing and conflicted/contaminated behaviors. An emerging neurocircuit encompassing the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been functionally linked to symptoms including reward contamination and body dysmorphic processing. Owing to the significantly greater prevalence of AN in females, evidence from clinical literature and preclinical models is spearheaded to provide a novel rationale for estrogen triggering sensitivity to the experience of stress and reward, precipitating AN disproportionately in females at the time of puberty. Paradoxically, however, estrogen may facilitate response to pharmacological interventions and (desensitization of the identified neurocircuits) via its contribution to serotonin modulation, hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal (HPA)-axis attenuation, and effects on dopamine."

The initial key findings in ED patients of plasma immunoglobulins (Ig) that react with α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a neuropeptide in the brain signaling satiety, have initiated further studies leading to the discovery of the origin of such autoantibodies and to the understanding their possible functional role. An anorexigenic bacterial protein Escherichia coli caseinolytic protease B was recently found to be responsible for the production of α-MSH-cross-reactive autoantibodies and this protein was also detected in human plasma. Another recent study revealed enhanced activation of appetite-regulating the melanocortin type 4 receptor by immune complexes withα-MSH. Taken together, these data serve to build a pathophysiological model of ED presented in this article."

The underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood, despite its potential importance in explaining the neuropsychological deficits and clinical symptoms associated with the illness. We used the activity-based anorexia model (ABA), which includes food reduction and running wheel access in female rats to study brain changes after starvation and refeeding. Longitudinal animal MRI and post-mortem brain sections confirmed a reduction in the mean brain volumes of ABA animals compared to controls. In addition, the mean number of astrocytes was reduced by over 50% in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum, while the mean number of neurons was unchanged. Furthermore, mean astrocytic GFAP mRNA expression was similarly reduced in the ABA animals, as was the mean cell proliferation rate, whereas the mean apoptosis rate did not increase. After refeeding, the starvation-induced effects were almost completely reversed. The observation of the astrocyte reduction in our AN animal model is an important new finding that could help explain starvation-induced neuropsychological changes in patients with AN. Astrocyte-targeted research and interventions could become a new focus for both AN research and therapy."

This is seemingly in contrast to the loss of energy and fatigue characteristic of other starvation states associated with weight loss. Despite the fact that historical accounts and clinical case studies of AN have regularly commented on the elevated activity levels, the behavior has become only recently the subject of systematic study. Because rodents and other species increase their activity upon food restriction leading to weight loss when given access to an activity wheel--a phenomenon referred to as activity-based anorexia or semi-starvation-induced hyperactivity (SIH)-it has been proposed that the hyperactivity in AN patients may reflect the mobilization of phylogenetically old pathways in individuals predisposed to AN. Exogeneous application of leptin in this animal model of AN has recently been shown to suppress completely the development of SIH. Hypoleptinemia, as a result of the food restriction, may represent the initial trigger for the increased activity levels in AN patients and in food-restricted rats. In the first and second parts of our review, we will summarize the relevant findings pertaining to hyperactivity in AN patients and in the rat model, respectively. We conclude with a synopsis and implications for future research."

Importantly, such disturbances are present when subjects are ill and persist after recovery, suggesting that these may be traits that are independent of the state of the illness. Emerging data point to a dysregulation of serotonin pathways in cortical and limbic structures that may be related to anxiety, behavioral inhibition, and body image distortions. In specific, recent studies using PET with serotonin specific radioligands implicate alterations of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and the 5-HT transporter.

Among the inflammatory mediators acting at both peripheral and central levels, growing attention receives a class of lipids derived from arachidonic acid (AA), called eicosanoids (eiCs), which exert a complex, multifaceted role in a wide range of neuroinflammatory processes, peripheral inflammation, and generally in immune system function. To date, little is known about their possible involvement in the neurobiological underpinnings of AN. The present study evaluated whether the activity-based model of AN (ABA) may alter AA-metabolic pathways by changing the levels of AA-derived eiCs in specific brain areas implicated in the development of the typical anorexic-like phenotype, i.e. in prefrontal cortex, cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cerebellum. Our results point to brain region-specific alterations of the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (CYP) metabolic pathways rendering altered levels of AA-derived eiCs (i.e. prostaglandins, thromboxanes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) in response to induction of and recovery from the ABA condition. These changes, supported by altered messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of genes coding for enzymes involved in eiCs-related methabolic pathways (i.e., PLA2, COX-2, 5-LOX and 15-LOX), underlie a widespread brain dysregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory eiC-mediated processes in the ABA model of AN. These data suggest the importance of eiCs signaling within corticolimbic areas in regulating key neurobehavioral functions and highlight eiCs as biomarker candidates for monitoring the onset and development of AN, and/or as possible targets for pharmacological management."

Importantly, ACBP levels were elevated in obese patients and reduced in anorexia nervosa. In mice, systemic injection of ACBP protein inhibited autophagy, induced lipogenesis, reduced glycemia, and stimulated appetite as well as weight gain. We designed three approaches to neutralize ACBP, namely, inducible whole-body knockout, systemic administration of neutralizing antibodies, and induction of antiACBP autoantibodies in mice. ACBP neutralization enhanced autophagy, stimulated fatty acid oxidation, inhibited appetite, reduced weight gain in the context of a high-fat diet or leptin deficiency, and accelerated weight loss in response to dietary changes. In conclusion, neutralization of ACBP might constitute a strategy for treating obesity and its co-morbidities."

ClpB (Caseinolytic peptidase B) protein produced mainly by the Enterobacteriaceae family has been identified as a conformational mimetic of α-MSH, which could result in similar anorexigenic effects. The aim of this study was to highlight the role of the microbiome and the ClpB protein in deregulation and self-maintenance of anorexia pathology. Male C57Bl/6 mice were undergone to the ABA (Activity-Based Anorexia) protocol: after 5 days of acclimatization, both ABA and LFA (Limited Food Access) mice had progressively limited access to food until D17. At the end of protocol, the plasma ClpB concentration and Enterobacteriaceae DNA in colonic content were measured. As expected, dietary restriction induced lost weight in LFA and ABA mice. At D10, colonic permeability and plasma concentration of the ClpB protein were significantly increased in LFA and ABA mice vs. controls. At D17, plasma concentration of ClpB was increased in LFA and ABA mice and, it was correlated with proportion of Enterobacteriaceae in the faeces.

"['Barbarich NC', 'Kaye WH', 'Jimerson D.']",Neurotransmitter and imaging studies in anorexia nervosa: new targets for treatment.,Curr Drug Targets CNS Neurol Disord,"Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa are disorders of unknown etiology that invariably begin during adolescence and near in time to puberty in young women. These disorders are associated with aberrant eating behaviors, body image distortions, impulse and mood disturbances, as well as characteristic temperament and personality traits. It is well known that malnutrition produces changes in neuroendocrine function. More recently, disturbances in neuronal systems have been found to play a role in the modulation of feeding, mood, and impulse control. These neuronal systems include neuropeptides (CRH, opioids, neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and peptide YY (PYY), vasopressin and oxytocin, CCK, and leptin) and monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine). Disturbances of most of these neuronal systems have been found when people are ill with an eating disorder, but it was not certain whether they were a cause or consequence of symptoms. In order to address these questions, a growing number of studies have investigated whether neuromodulatory disturbances persist after recovery. Studies from several centers tend to show altered serotonin activity persists after prolonged normalization of weight, nutrition, and menstrual function, as do anxiety, obsessionality, and perfectionism. While there are fewer data, there may be persistent alterations of dopamine or some neuropeptides in some subjects in a recovered state. The inaccessibility of the central nervous system has made it difficult to understand brain and behavior. In the past decade, new tools, such as brain imaging, have offered the possibility of better characterization of complex neuronal function and behavior. Such studies have tended to consistently find that alterations of brain regions, such as the temporal lobe, occur in people who are ill with anorexia nervosa and appear to persist after some degree of weight gain and recovery. New imaging technology, that marries Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with selective neurotransmitter radioligands, confirms that altered serotonin neuronal pathway activity persists after recovery from an eating disorder and supports the possibility that these psychobiological alterations might contribute to traits, such as increased anxiety or extremes of impulse control, that, in turn, may contribute to a vulnerability to the development of an eating disorder. In summary, studies of pathophysiology are starting to nominate new candidates for treatment leading to the possibility of finding effective treatments for this often chronic or fatal disorder."

AN is generally viewed as a psychosomatic disorder mediated by obsessive concerns about weight, perfectionism and an overwhelming desire to be thin. By contrast, the thesis that will be developed here is that, AN is primarily a metabolic disorder caused by defective regulation of the starvation response, which leads to ambivalence towards food, decreased food consumption and characteristic psychopathology. We will trace the starvation response from yeast to man and describe the central role of insulin (and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1))/Akt/ F-box transcription factor (FOXO) signaling in this response. Akt is a serine/threonine kinase downstream of the insulin and IGF-1 receptors, whereas FOXO refers to the subfamily of Forkhead box O transcription factors, which are regulated by Akt. We will also discuss how initial bouts of caloric restriction may alter the production of neurotransmitters that regulate appetite and food-seeking behavior and thus, set in motion a vicious cycle. Finally, an integrated approach to treatment will be outlined that addresses the biological aspects of AN."

Unfortunately, no single investigation can encompass all of the variables that need to be measured that affect eating behavior. The studies described of both acutely ill and short-term recovered eating disorder patients indicate there may be some perceptual and physiological traits that are present in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

In addition, they share symptoms, such as extremes of food consumption, body image distortion, anxiety and obsessions, and ego-syntonic neglect. Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that these symptoms reflect disturbed brain function, which contributes to the pathophysiology of these illnesses. Several lines of evidence suggest that disturbances of serotonin (5-HT) pathways play a role. First, 5-HT pathways contribute to the modulation of feeding, mood, and impulse control. Second, medications that act on 5-HT pathways have some degree of efficacy in individuals with AN and BN. Third, such disturbances are present when subjects are ill and persist after recovery, suggesting that 5-HT alterations may be traits that are independent of the state of the illness. Positron emission tomography (PET) with radioligands offers an opportunity to directly characterize brain 5-HT pathways and their relationship with behavior. For example, reduced 5-HT(2A) receptor function occurs in AN whereas increased 5-HT(1A) receptor function occurs in BN. Moreover, imaging studies correlate altered 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptor function with traits often found in individuals with AN and BN, such as harm avoidance. Finally, alteration of these receptors tends to implicate pathways involving frontal, cingulate, temporal, and parietal regions. Alterations of these circuits may affect mood and impulse control as well as the motivating and hedonic aspects of feeding behavior. Such imaging studies may offer insights into new pharmacology and psychotherapy approaches."

Besides severe weight loss, excessive physical exercise and cognitive disturbances can be present in patients with AN as primary symptoms of the pathology or as secondary effects induced by physical and metabolic alterations. Mechanistic research in this field has taken advantage of a well characterized animal model, the activity-based anorexia model (ABA). ABA rodents and subjects with AN show clear behavioral and physiological similarities, but a throughout neurocognitive assessment of the model is still missing. Here, we review the available literature in the ABA field, highlighting similarities between ABA and AN at the behavioral, neurophysiological and cognitive level. Furthermore, based on availability, feasibility and adaptability of rodent behavioral protocols, we propose a set of neurocognitive assays that can be performed on the ABA. The proposed assessment represents an important step forward in the validation and extension of the ABA model, opening several routes of investigation related to AN and other eating disorders."
"['Welch AC', 'Katzka WR', 'Dulawa SC.']",Assessing Activity-based Anorexia in Mice.,J Vis Exp,"Rodents develop activity-based anorexia (ABA) when exposed to a restricted feeding schedule and allowed free access to a running wheel. These conditions lead to a life-threatening reduction in body weight. However, rodents exposed to only one of these conditions ultimately adapt to re-establish normal body weight. Although increased running coupled with reduction in voluntary food intake appear paradoxical under ABA conditions, ABA behavior is observed across numerous mammalian species. The ABA paradigm provides an animal model for anorexia nervosa (AN), an eating disorder with severe dysregulation of appetite-behavior. Subjects are singly housed with free access to a running wheel. Each day, the subject is offered food for a limited amount of time. During the course of the experiment, a subject's body weight decreases from high activity and low caloric intake. The duration of the study varies based on how long food is offered daily, the type of food offered, the strain of mouse, if drugs are being tested, and environmental factors. A lack of effective pharmacological treatments for AN patients, their low quality of life, high cost of treatment, and their high mortality rate indicate the urgency to further research AN. We provide a basic outline for performing ABA experiments with mice, offering a method to investigate AN-like behavior in order to develop novel therapies. This protocol is optimized for use in Balb/cJ mice, but can easily be manipulated for other strains, providing great flexibility in working with different questions, especially related to genetic factors of ABA."
['Fessler DM.'],Pseudoparadoxical impulsivity in restrictive anorexia nervosa: a consequence of the logic of scarcity.,Int J Eat Disord,"Objective:
        
      
      To explain an apparently paradoxical pattern wherein sufferers of restrictive anorexia nervosa exhibit both rigorous self-restraint and episodic impulsivity.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The experimental, historical, and clinical literatures were examined for evidence of psychological and behavioral changes accompanying severe dietary constriction; such changes were noted and compared with those reported to occur in anorexics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Increased impulsivity in association with dietary constriction is described in diverse literatures. A number of lines of evidence suggest that the serotonergic system mediates this change.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Many forms of impulsivity can be understood as having once constituted fitness-enhancing responses to resource scarcity. It is suggested that an evolved psychological mechanism calibrates the individual's sensitivity to risk in light of future prospects. Self-injurious behaviors are explicable as misfirings of such a mechanism. Similarly, excessive exercising by anorexics may reflect the misdirection of reward systems that normally encourage adaptive increases in ranging behavior under conditions of scarcity."

Here, we studied the contribution of exercise and diet to the reinforcing value of food during ABA development. Three groups of eight adult male Wistar rats were used: an ABA group with 21.5 hr (then 22 hr) of wheel access and 1 hr (then 30 min) of food access, a control group with the same time exposure to food but without exercise, and a yoked group to the ABA in terms of weight loss. Rats were daily tested on a progressive-ratio schedule to measure their motivation for food. ABA rats gradually reduced their body weight more than the food control group. Animals steadily increased their breaking points in parallel to losses in body weight, but no significant differences were found between groups. Adult rats can develop ABA, but their loss in weight neither resulted in a decrease of food intake nor in the motivation to obtain it."

So far, pharmacological treatment has focused on a narrow range of drugs and only a few controlled studies have been performed. Furthermore, the studies have been of short duration and included a limited number of subjects, often heterogenic with regard to stage and acute nutritive status. Thus, novel approaches are urgently needed. Body weight homeostasis is tightly regulated throughout life. With the discovery of orexigenic and anorectic signals, an array of new molecular targets to control eating behavior has emerged. This review focuses on recent advances in three important signal systems: leptin, ghrelin, and endocannabinoids toward the identification of potential therapeutical breakthroughs in AN. Our review of the current literature shows that leptin may have therapeutic potentials in promoting restoration of menstrual cycles in weight restored patients, reducing motor restlessness in severely hyperactive patients, and preventing osteoporosis in chronic patients. Ghrelin and endocannabinoids exert orexigenic effects which may facilitate nutritional restoration. Leptin and endocannabinoids may exert antidepressive and anxiolytic effects. Finally, monitoring serum concentration of leptin may be useful in order to prevent refeeding syndrome."

Alternatively, ambient temperature is a key modulating factor of activity in semi-starved rats. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of leptin with increased ambient temperature in the prevention of hyperactivity in semi-starved rats. 74 Sprague-Dawley male rats were employed in two experiments with the difference residing in the length of baseline. After an extended (28 days), or shorter (14 days) baseline with free access to food and the running wheel, housed at 21 °C, animals were either ad-lib feed or food restricted (60% of food ingested during previous week) and infused with same amount of leptin at 21 °C, 25 °C, or vehicle at 21 °C, 25 °C and 32 °C for a week. Animals housed at 32 °C significantly reduced wheel running and weight loss during food restriction while animals given leptin did not yield no differences in activity or weight loss. Moreover, unlike animals housed at 32 °C, body temperature of leptin infused animals housed at 21 °C was significantly reduced during food restriction. Furthermore, leptin treated rats without a preceding stable pattern of activity displayed a severe dysregulation of circadian rhythm in activity and a collapse of body temperature. Housing temperature plays a more critical role than leptin in the regulation of semi-starvation induced hyperactivity in rats, which may be of relevance for the management of hyperactivity in anorexia nervosa."
"['Allen PJ', 'Jimerson DC', 'Kanarek RB', 'Kocsis B.']",Impaired reversal learning in an animal model of anorexia nervosa.,Physiol Behav,"Background:
        
      
      Clinical investigations indicate that anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with impaired cognitive flexibility. Activity-based anorexia (ABA), a rodent behavioral model of AN, is characterized by compulsive wheel running associated with voluntary food restriction and progressive weight loss. The goal of this study was to test whether ABA is associated with impaired cognitive flexibility.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to perform the attentional set-shifting test (ASST) to assess cognitive flexibility, including capacity for set-shifting and reversal learning. Rats were assigned to ABA or weight-loss paired control (WPC) conditions. Following baseline testing, the ABA group had access to food for 1h/d and access to running wheels 23h/d until 20% weight loss was voluntarily achieved. For the WPC group, running wheels were locked and access to food was restricted to reduce body weight at the same rate as the ABA group. ASST performance was assessed after weight loss, and again following weight recovery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared to baseline, the ABA group (but not the WPC group) showed a significant decrement in reversal learning at low weight, with return to baseline performance following weight restoration. The other components of ASST were not affected.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Impaired reversal learning, indicative of increased perseverative responding, in the ABA model reveals its potential to recapitulate selective components of cortical dysfunction in AN. This finding supports the utility of the ABA model for investigations of the neural mechanisms underlying such deficits. Reversal learning relies on neural circuits involving the orbitofrontal cortex and thus the results implicate orbitofrontal abnormalities in AN-like state."

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by a persistent restriction of energy intake, leading to lowered body weight, constant fear of gaining weight, and psychological disturbances of body perception. Herein, we demonstrate that SIRT1 inhibition, both genetically and pharmacologically, delays the onset and progression of AN behaviors in activity-based anorexia (ABA) models, while SIRT1 activation accelerates ABA phenotypes. Mechanistically, we suggest that SIRT1 promotes progression of ABA, in part through its interaction with NRF1, leading to suppression of a NMDA receptor subunit Grin2A. Our results suggest that AN may arise from pathological positive feedback loops: voluntary food restriction activates SIRT1, promoting anxiety, hyperactivity, and addiction to starvation, exacerbating the dieting and exercising, thus further activating SIRT1. We propose SIRT1 inhibition can break this cycle and provide a potential therapy for individuals suffering from AN."

The neurobiology of the disorder is unknown but recently magnetic resonance imaging showed a volume reduction of the hippocampus in anorexic patients. Dehydration-induced anorexia (DIA) is a murine model that mimics core features of this disorder, including severe weight loss due to voluntary reduction in food intake. The energy supply to the brain is mediated by astrocytes, but whether their density is compromised by anorexia is unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate GFAP+ cell density in the main regions of the hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus) in the DIA model. Our results showed that GFAP+ cell density was significantly reduced (~20%) in all regions of the hippocampus, except in CA1. Interestingly, DIA significantly reduced the GFAP+ cells/nuclei ratio in CA2 (-23%) and dentate gyrus (-48%). The reduction of GFAP+ cell density was in agreement with a lower expression of GFAP protein. Additionally, anorexia increased the expression of the intermediate filaments vimentin and nestin. Accordingly, anorexia increased the number of reactive astrocytes in CA2 and dentate gyrus more than twofold. We conclude that anorexia reduces the hippocampal GFAP+ cell density and increases vimentin and nestin expression."

Since then, ghrelin has been found to exert a plethora of physiological effects that go far beyond its initial characterization as a growth hormone (GH) secretagogue. Among the numerous well-established effects of ghrelin are the stimulation of appetite and lipid accumulation, the modulation of immunity and inflammation, the stimulation of gastric motility, the improvement of cardiac performance, the modulation of stress, anxiety, taste sensation and reward-seeking behavior, as well as the regulation of glucose metabolism and thermogenesis. Due to a variety of beneficial effects on systems' metabolism, pharmacological targeting of the endogenous ghrelin system is widely considered a valuable approach to treat metabolic complications, such as chronic inflammation, gastroparesis or cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia. The aim of this review is to discuss and highlight the broad pharmacological potential of ghrelin pathway modulation for the treatment of anorexia, cachexia, sarcopenia, cardiopathy, neurodegenerative disorders, renal and pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, inflammatory disorders and metabolic syndrome."
"['Bailer UF', 'Kaye WH.']",A review of neuropeptide and neuroendocrine dysregulation in anorexia and bulimia nervosa.,Curr Drug Targets CNS Neurol Disord,"Neuropeptides play an important role in the regulation of feeding behavior and obesity. The mechanisms for controlling food intake involve a complicated interplay between peripheral systems (including gustatory stimulation, gastrointestinal peptide secretion, and vagal afferent nerve responses) and central nervous system (CNS) neuropeptides and/or monoamines. These neuronal systems include neuropeptides (CRH, opioids, neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and peptide YY (PYY), vasopressin and oxytocin, CCK, and leptin) and monamines (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine). In addition to regulating eating behavior, a number of CNS neuropeptides participate in the regulation of neuroendocrine pathways. Thus, clinical studies have evaluated the possibility that CNS neuropeptide alterations may contribute to dysregulated secretion of the gonadal hormones, cortisol, thyroid hormones and growth hormone in the eating disorders. Most of the neuroendocrine and neuropeptide alterations apparent during symptomatic episodes of AN and BN tend to normalize after recovery. This observation suggests that most of the disturbances are consequences rather than causes of malnutrition, weight loss and/or altered meal patterns. Still, an understanding of these neuropeptide disturbances may shed light on why many people with AN or BN cannot easily ""reverse"" their illness and even after weight gain and normalized eating patterns, many individuals who have recovered from AN or BN have physiological, behavioral and psychological symptoms that persist for extended periods of time."

Advances in leptin physiology have established that the main role of this hormone is to signal energy availability in energy-deficient states. Studies in animals and human beings have shown that low concentrations of leptin are fully or partly responsible for starvation-induced changes in neuroendocrine axes, including low reproductive, thyroid, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) hormones. Disease states such as exercise-induced hypothalamic amenorrhoea and anorexia nervosa are also associated with low concentrations of leptin and a similar spectrum of neuroendocrine abnormalities. We have recently shown in an interventional, proof-of-concept study that leptin can restore ovulatory menstrual cycles and improve reproductive, thyroid, and IGF hormones and bone markers in hypothalamic amenorrhoea. Further studies are warranted to establish the safety and effectiveness of leptin for the infertility and osteoporosis associated with hypothalamic amenorrhoea, and to clarify its role in anorexia nervosa."

Young female Sabra mice were treated with vehicle, 2-AG, 2-AG+entourage, 2-AG+entourage+5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)- 4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716A, a CB1 antagonist) and SR141716A. The mice were fed for 2.5h a day for 14days. Cognitive function was evaluated by the eight arm maze test, and neurotransmitter (norepinephrine, dopamine, L-DOPA and serotonin) levels were measured in the hippocampus and hypothalamus by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection. Food intake was increased by 2-AG and, to an even greater extent, by 2-AG+entourage. SR141716A reversed the effect of 2-AG+entourage. The administration of 2-AG+entourage improved cognitive function compared to the vehicle mice, and this improvement was blocked by SR141716A. 2-AG+entourage-treated mice showed an increase in norepinephrine (NE), dopamine and L-DOPA levels in the hippocampus. SR141716A normalized NE and L-DOPA levels. There were no significant changes in hypothalamic neurotransmitter levels. The use of very low doses of the endocannabinoid 2-AG+entourage can improve cognitive function by elevating norepinephrine and L-DOPA levels in the hippocampus, without cannabinomimetic side effects. These findings may have implications for cognitive enhancement in anorexia nervosa."
"['Chowdhury TG', 'Chen YW', 'Aoki C.']",Using the Activity-based Anorexia Rodent Model to Study the Neurobiological Basis of Anorexia Nervosa.,J Vis Exp,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric illness characterized by excessively restricted caloric intake and abnormally high levels of physical activity. A challenging illness to treat, due to the lack of understanding of the underlying neurobiology, AN has the highest mortality rate among psychiatric illnesses. To address this need, neuroscientists are using an animal model to study how neural circuits may contribute toward vulnerability to AN and may be affected by AN. Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is a bio-behavioral phenomenon described in rodents that models the key symptoms of anorexia nervosa. When rodents with free access to voluntary exercise on a running wheel experience food restriction, they become hyperactive - running more than animals with free access to food. Here, we describe the procedures by which ABA is induced in adolescent female C57BL/6 mice. On postnatal day 36 (P36), the animal is housed with access to voluntary exercise on a running wheel. After 4 days of acclimation to the running wheel, on P40, all food is removed from the cage. For the next 3 days, food is returned to the cage (allowing animals free food access) for 2 hr daily. After the fourth day of food restriction, free access to food is returned and the running wheel is removed from the cage to allow the animals to recover. Continuous multi-day analysis of running wheel activity shows that mice become hyperactive within 24 hr following the onset of food restriction. The mice run even during the limited time during which they have access to food. Additionally, the circadian pattern of wheel running becomes disrupted by the experience of food restriction. We have been able to correlate neurobiological changes with various aspects of the animals' wheel running behavior to implicate particular brain regions and neurochemical changes with resilience and vulnerability to food-restriction induced hyperactivity."

Hyperactivity is a key driving force to starvation in an animal model named activity-based anorexia (ABA). Recent research has started unraveling what mechanisms underlie this hyperactivity. Besides a general increase in locomotor activity that may be an expression of foraging behavior and involves frontal brain regions, the increased locomotor activity expressed before food is presented (food anticipatory behavior or FAA) involves hypothalamic neural circuits. Ghrelin plays a role in FAA, whereas decreased leptin signaling is involved in both aspects of increased locomotor activity. We hypothesize that increased ghrelin and decreased leptin signaling drive the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. In anorexia nervosa patients, this altered activity of the dopamine system may be involved not only in hyperactivity but also in aberrant cognitive processing related to food."

During the first year of treatment, height velocity significantly increased from a mean 2.8 cm/year at baseline to a mean 8.0 cm/year; mean growth velocities remained above baseline for up to 8 years. Mecasermin also promoted statural growth in a small noncomparative trial in children with growth failure and GH insensitivity syndrome (n = 8). After 6.5-7.5 years of mecasermin therapy, the mean increase in the height standard deviation score was +1.4. Mecasermin was also shown to have beneficial effects in various other conditions including diabetes mellitus and anorexia nervosa. Subcutaneous mecasermin was generally well tolerated in children with severe IGF-I deficiency associated with GH insensitivity."
"['Scacchi M', 'Pincelli AI', 'Cavagnini F.']",Nutritional status in the neuroendocrine control of growth hormone secretion: the model of anorexia nervosa.,Front Neuroendocrinol,"Growth hormone (GH) plays a key role not only in the promotion of linear growth but also in the regulation of intermediary metabolism, body composition, and energy expenditure. On the whole, the hormone appears to direct fuel metabolism towards the preferential oxidation of lipids instead of glucose and proteins, and to convey the energy derived from metabolic processes towards the synthesis of proteins. On the other hand, body energy stores and circulating energetic substrates take an important part in the regulation of somatotropin release. Finally, central and peripheral peptides participating in the control of food intake and energy expenditure (neuropeptide Y, leptin, and ghrelin) are also involved in the regulation of GH secretion. Altogether, nutritional status has to be regarded as a major determinant in the regulation of the somatotropin-somatomedin axis in animals and humans. In these latter, overweight is associated with marked impairment of spontaneous and stimulated GH release, while acute dietary restriction and chronic undernutrition induce an amplification of spontaneous secretion together with a clear-cut decrease in insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) plasma levels. Thus, over- and undernutrition represent two conditions connoted by GH hypersensitivity and GH resistance, respectively. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by peculiar changes of the GH-IGF-I axis. In these patients, low circulating IGF-I levels are associated with enhanced GH production rate, highly disordered mode of somatotropin release, and variability of GH responsiveness to different pharmacological challenges. These abnormalities are likely due not only to the lack of negative IGF-I feedback, but also to a primary hypothalamic alteration with increased frequency of growth hormone releasing hormone discharges and decreased somatostatinergic tone. Given the reversal of the above alterations following weight recovery, these abnormalities can be seen as secondary, and possibly adaptive, to nutritional deprivation. The model of AN may provide important insights into the pathophysiology of GH secretion, in particular as regards the mechanisms whereby nutritional status effects its regulation."

Those pathways are implicated in the premature development of vascular and metabolic comorbidities, which account for considerable morbidity and mortality, including increased dementia risk. During endoplasmic reticulum stress, the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme converts anti-inflammatory fatty acid epoxides generated by cytochrome p450 enzymes into their corresponding and generally less anti-inflammatory, or even pro-inflammatory, diols, slowing the resolution of inflammation. The sEH enzyme and its oxylipin products are elevated post-mortem in MDD, BD and schizophrenia. Preliminary clinical data suggest that oxylipins increase with symptoms in seasonal MDD and anorexia nervosa, requiring confirmation in larger studies and other cohorts. In rats, a soluble sEH inhibitor mitigated the development of depressive-like behaviors. We discuss sEH inhibitors under development for cardiovascular diseases, post-ischemic brain injury, neuropathic pain and diabetes, suggesting new possibilities to address the mood and cognitive symptoms of psychiatric disorders, and their most common comorbidities."

      Anorexia nervosa is a primary psychiatric disorder, with non-negligible rates of mortality and morbidity. Some of the related alterations could participate in a vicious cycle limiting the recovery. Animal models mimicking various physiological alterations related to anorexia nervosa are necessary to provide better strategies of treatment.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To explore physiological alterations and recovery in a long-term mouse model mimicking numerous consequences of severe anorexia nervosa.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      C57Bl/6 female mice were submitted to a separation-based anorexia protocol combining separation and time-restricted feeding for 10 weeks. Thereafter, mice were housed in standard conditions for 10 weeks. Body weight, food intake, body composition, plasma levels of leptin, adiponectin, IGF-1, blood levels of GH, reproductive function and glucose tolerance were followed. Gene expression of several markers of lipid and energy metabolism was assayed in adipose tissues.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mimicking what is observed in anorexia nervosa patients, and despite a food intake close to that of control mice, separation-based anorexia mice displayed marked alterations in body weight, fat mass, lean mass, bone mass acquisition, reproductive function, GH/IGF-1 axis, and leptinemia. mRNA levels of markers of lipogenesis, lipolysis, and the brown-like adipocyte lineage in subcutaneous adipose tissue were also changed. All these alterations were corrected during the recovery phase, except for the hypoleptinemia that persisted despite the full recovery of fat mass.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study strongly supports the separation-based anorexia protocol as a valuable model of long-term negative energy balance state that closely mimics various symptoms observed in anorexia nervosa, including metabolic adaptations. Interestingly, during a recovery phase, mice showed a high capacity to normalize these parameters with the exception of plasma leptin levels. It will be interesting therefore to explore further the central and peripheral effects of the uncorrected hypoleptinemia during recovery from separation-based anorexia."

Since the pathophysiology of AN is yet poorly understood and specific drug treatments are lacking so far, animal models might be useful to further understand this disease. ABA consists of time-restricted access to food for 1.5 h/day and the possibility to exercise in a running wheel for 24 h/day. This combination leads to robust body weight loss as observed in AN. Here, we investigated the activation of brain corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons, a transmitter involved in the response to stress, emotional processes and also food intake. After development of ABA, rat brains were processed for c-Fos and CRF double immunohistochemistry. ABA increased the number of c-Fos/CRF double labeled neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) compared to the ad libitum (AL, ad libitum fed, no running wheel) and activity (AC, ad libitum fed, running wheel, p < 0.05) but not to the restricted feeding (RF, food for 1.5 h/day, no running wheel, p > 0.05) group. Also the number of CRF neurons was increased in the DMH of ABA rats compared to AL and AC (p < 0.05). In the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW) the number of c-Fos positive neurons was increased in ABA and RF compared to AC (p < 0.05), while the number of double labeled neurons was not different (p > 0.05). Taken together, brain CRF activated under conditions of ABA might play a role in the development and maintenance of this animal model and possibly also in human AN."

Due to the parallelism with the clinical manifestations of anorexia nervosa including increased activity, reduced food intake and severe weight loss, the ABA procedure has been proposed as the best analog of human anorexia nervosa (AN).

      New refinements of the circuits regulated by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides which instigate eating behaviours and the various feedback pathways which monitor acute and chronic nutrient status continue to be discovered. Moreover, work with the animal models that simulate the behavioural features and risk factors related to eating disorders is flourishing and providing new insights into possible causal mechanisms. For example, rodents develop binge-eating behaviours if they are intermittently exposed to processed, palatable foods and/or sugar adulterated drinks. This led to the controversial conceptualization of binge eating as a form of food addiction. Self-starvation taken to a fatal consequence such as occurs in anorexia nervosa can emerge in rodents exposed to triggers like social exclusion and/or the opportunity to exercise.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      There are plausible animal models for both anorexia nervosa and binge-eating disorders. These can be used to elaborate the theoretical models to explain the mechanisms underpinning eating disorders."

Different animal models of EDs have been developed to investigate pharmacological, environmental, and genetic determinants that contribute to the development and maintenance of these disorders as well as for the identification of potential therapeutic targets. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the most useful animal models of EDs, focusing mainly on those used to study anorexia nervosa and binge eating disorder."

Recent trials focusing on the abnormal cognitive and emotional aspects of bulimia have reported a remission rate of about 45%, and a relapse rate of about 30% within one year. However, an early CBT trial that emphasized the normalization of eating behavior had a better outcome than treatment that focused on cognitive intervention. In support of this finding, another treatment, that restores a normal eating behavior using mealtime feedback, has an estimated remission rate of about 75% and a relapse rate of about 10% over five years. Moreover, when eating behavior was normalized, cognitive and emotional abnormalities were resolved at remission without cognitive therapy. The critical aspect of the CBT treatment of bulimia nervosa therefore may actually have been the normalization of eating behavior."

Administration of extra ACBP is orexigenic and obesogenic, while its neutralization is anorexigenic in mice, suggesting that ACBP is a major stimulator of appetite and lipo-anabolism. Accordingly, obese persons have higher circulating ACBP levels than lean individuals, and anorexia nervosa is associated with subnormal ACBP plasma concentrations. Here, we investigated whether ACBP might play a phylogenetically conserved role in appetite stimulation. We found that extracellular ACBP favors sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, knowing that sporulation is a strategy for yeast to seek new food sources. Moreover, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, ACBP increased the ingestion of bacteria as well as the frequency pharyngeal pumping. These observations indicate that ACBP has a phylogenetically ancient role as a 'hunger factor' that favors food intake."
"['Milton LK', 'Oldfield BJ', 'Foldi CJ.']",Evaluating anhedonia in the activity-based anorexia (ABA) rat model.,Physiol Behav,"Patients suffering anorexia nervosa (AN) become anhedonic, in other words, unable or unwilling to derive normal pleasures and avoid rewarding outcomes, most profoundly in food intake. The neurobiological underpinnings of anhedonia are likely to involve mesolimbic reward circuitry. We propose here that this circuitry and its involvement in AN can be investigated using the activity-based anorexia (ABA) rodent model that recapitulates many of the characteristics of the human condition, most notably rapid weight loss. Preference for sweetened water was used to assay hedonic processing in female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to the ABA protocol, which involves free access to running wheels paired with time-limited access to food. This protocol uncovered a transient anhedonia in only one quarter of cases; however, exposure to running wheels alone was associated with a rapid aversion to sweetened water (F1.833, 20.17 = 78.29, p < .0001), and time-limited food access alone did not impact preference (F2.205, 24.25 = 0.305, p = .761). High levels of running wheel activity prior to the onset of food restriction increased susceptibility to body weight loss in ABA (F10,196.129 = 2.069, p = .029) and food anticipatory activity predicted subsequent food intake only for rats that were resistant to body weight loss (r = 0.44, p = .001). These data are inconsistent with the hypothesis that anhedonia underscores the precipitous weight loss in ABA, however, they highlight the predictive nature of hyperactivity in susceptibility to the ABA paradigm. These results will help inform the neurobiological framework of ABA and provide insight into the mechanisms of reward relevant to feeding and weight loss."

Several promising areas of translational research in AN are identified. Such research, particularly when linked to a conceptual framework, offers the potential of lending much-needed novel insight into this challenging and enigmatic disorder."
['Bruch H.'],Anorexia Nervosa: therapy and theory.,Am J Psychiatry,"The reciprocal interaction between psychotherapy and theoretical assumptions is illustrated through observations of anorexia nervosa. Traditional psychoanalysis, with its emphasis on interpretation of unconscious processes, was found to be rather ineffective, whereas an approach evoking active participation on the part of the patient led to better treatment results. The experience of being listened to appeared to be of utmost importance. The characteristic deficits in self-concept and body awareness could be related to a paucity or an absence of confirming responses in the early mother-child interactions. This concept reinforced the focus on encouragement of initiative and autonomy during therapy."
"['Gutierrez E', 'Cerrato M', 'Carrera O', 'Vazquez R.']",Heat reversal of activity-based anorexia: implications for the treatment of anorexia nervosa.,Int J Eat Disord,"Objective:
        
      
      Activity-based anorexia (ABA) provides an animal model of anorexia nervosa (AN). In this model, rats given restricted access to food but unrestricted access to activity wheels, run excessively while reducing food intake, lose a sizeable percentage of body weight, become hypothermic, and can fail to recover unless removed from these conditions.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Once rats had lost 20% of body weight under standard ABA conditions, they were assigned to one of two ambient temperature (AT) conditions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Increased AT reduced running rates and led to weight gain in active rats. The effect of increasing AT on food intake was dependent on whether the rats were sedentary or active. Although warming reduced food intake in the sedentary rats their body weight remained stable, whereas in active rats increased AT did not reduce food intake and weight gain gradually rose.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      From a translational perspective, these findings offer a fresh perspective to the disorder, and underscore the need for further studies to assess the effects of heat treatment in patients as an innovative adjunctive treatment for anorexia nervosa."

      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is often a chronic eating disorder characterised by body image disturbance and low body weight often associated with starvation-induced amenorrhoea and excessive exercise. Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is an animal model representing many somatic aspects of this psychiatric illness. We systematically manipulated the extent and length of starvation and animal age to find the optimal parameters to study chronic starvation.
    


          New methods:
        
      
      Wistar rats had 24h/day running wheel access and received 40% of their baseline food intake until a 20% or 25% weight reduction was reached (acute starvation). This body weight was then maintained for two weeks (chronic starvation). The rats of different ages of 4 or 8 weeks were used to represent early and late adolescent animals, respectively. The complete absence of a menstrual cycle was defined as the primary outcome parameter.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Acute starvation caused a disruption of the oestrous cycle in 58% of the animals. During chronic starvation, a complete loss of the oestrous cycle could be found. Furthermore, 4-week-old rats exhibited higher levels of hyperactivity and amenorrhoea than 8-week-old animals. A 20% starvation level led to 90% loss of cycle, while a 25% starvation level triggered complete loss.
    


          Comparison with existing methods:
        
      
      Most current ABA models focus on acute starvation, while most patients are chronically ill.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The optimal parameters to achieve complete amenorrhoea included early adolescence, chronic starvation and 25% weight loss. The new ABA model allows studying the effects of chronic AN on underlying behavioural, hormonal and brain pathobiology."

      Anorexia nervosa is a severe eating disorder often leading to malnutrition and cachexia, but its pathophysiology is still poorly defined. Chronic food restriction during anorexia nervosa may induce gut barrier dysfunction, which may contribute to disease development and its complications. Here we have characterized intestinal barrier function in mice with activity-based anorexia (ABA), an animal model of anorexia nervosa.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Male C57Bl/6 ABA or limited food access (LFA) mice were placed respectively in cages with or without activity wheel. After 5 days of acclimatization, both ABA and LFA mice had progressively limited access to food from 6 h/d at day 6 to 3 h/d at day 9 and until the end of experiment at day 17. A group of pair-fed mice (PF) was also compared to ABA.
    


          Results:
        
      
      On day 17, food intake was lower in ABA than LFA mice (2.0 ± 0.18 g vs. 3.0 ± 0.14 g, p < 0.001) and weight loss was more pronounced in ABA and PF compared to LFA mice (23.6 ± 1.6% and 24.7 ± 0.7% vs. 16.5 ± 1.2%; p < 0.05). Colonic histology showed decreased thickness of the muscularis layer in ABA compared to LFA mice (p < 0.05). Colonic permeability was increased in both ABA and PF compared to LFA mice (p < 0.05) but jejunal paracellular permeability was not affected. Expression of claudin-1 in the colon was lower in the ABA than the LFA group (p < 0.05), whereas occludin expression remained unaffected.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Increased colonic permeability and histological alterations found in ABA mice suggest that intestinal barrier dysfunction may also occur in anorexia nervosa. The role of these alterations in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa should be further evaluated."

      The objectives of this paper were to determine weight status, eating, and alcohol drinking and smoking habits of university students, to determine the association between these variables with negative self-perception of their eating habits and to assess the risk of developing eating disorders.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A cross-sectional study was carried out on 422 university students. The parameters analyzed were: nutritional status, eating habits, alcohol/ tobacco consumption, and risk of eating disorder. Logistic regression was applied to identify factors associated with a negative perception of eating habits.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of the whole population that was analyzed, 5% were underweight, 16% overweight and 4% obese. Fifty-five percent of the sample analyzed did not consume five meals a day. The recommended foods for daily consumption were consumed below recommendations, while sausages/fatty meats, industrial pastries, lean meats, and fish were over-consumed. Overall, the population perceived their eating habits as good/very good (63%). Alcohol and tobacco consumption predominated at weekends. The girls were more image-conscious (80.6% vs. 66%) and fearful of gaining weight (52.5% vs. 23.9%). Almost 30% had a distorted perception of body image. There was a 12.8% risk of atypical anorexia nervosa and 4.7% of atypical bulimia nervosa.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      College students led unhealthy lifestyles, mainly due to eating habits that do not conform to the establish recommendations. More than 17% are at risk of developing an atypical eating disorder. This information may be of interest in developing preventive actions."

Its etiology is unknown, which impedes successful treatment options leading to a limited chance of full recovery. Here, we show that gestation is a vulnerable window that can influence the predisposition to AN. By screening placental microRNA expression of naive and prenatally stressed (PNS) fetuses and assessing vulnerability to activity-based anorexia (ABA), we identify miR-340 as a sexually dimorphic regulator involved in prenatal programming of ABA. PNS caused gene-body hypermethylation of placental miR-340, which is associated with reduced miR-340 expression and increased protein levels of several target transcripts, GR, Cry2 and H3F3b. MiR-340 is linked to the expression of several nutrient transporters both in mice and human placentas. Using placenta-specific lentiviral transgenes and embryo transfer, we demonstrate the key role miR-340 plays in the mechanism involved in early life programming of ABA."

In ABA, scheduled feeding in combination with voluntary access to running wheels, results in hyperactivity, hypophagia, body weight loss and activation of the HPA axis. Since stimulation of the melanocortin (MC) system has similar effects, this system is a candidate system involved in ABA. Here it is shown that chronic alpha-MSH treatment enhances ABA by increasing running wheel activity (RWA), decreasing food intake and increasing HPA axis activation."

Animal models such as dehydration-induced anorexia (DIA) mimic core features of the disorder, including voluntary reduction in food intake, which compromises the supply of energy to the brain. Glial cells, the major population of nerve cells in the central nervous system, play a crucial role in supplying energy to the neurons. The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest white matter tract in mammals, and more than 99% of the cell somata correspond to glial cells in rodents. Whether glial cell density is altered in anorexia is unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate glial cell density in the three main regions of the CC (genu, body, and splenium) in a murine model of DIA. The astrocyte density was significantly reduced (~34%) for the DIA group in the body of the CC, whereas in the genu and the splenium no significant changes were observed. DIA and forced food restriction (FFR) also reduced the ratio of astrocytes to glial cells by 57.5% and 22%, respectively, in the body of CC. Thus, we conclude that DIA reduces astrocyte density only in the body of the rat CC."
"['Klenotich SJ', 'Dulawa SC.']",The activity-based anorexia mouse model.,Methods Mol Biol,"Animals housed with running wheels and subjected to daily food restriction show paradoxical reductions in food intake and increases in running wheel activity. This phenomenon, known as activity-based anorexia (ABA), leads to marked reductions in body weight that can ultimately lead to death. Recently, ABA has been proposed as a model of anorexia nervosa (AN). AN affects about 8 per 100,000 females and has the highest mortality rate among all psychiatric illnesses. Given the reductions in quality of life, high mortality rate, and the lack of pharmacological treatments for AN, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying AN-like behavior is greatly needed. This chapter provides basic guidelines for conducting ABA experiments using mice. The ABA mouse model provides an important tool for investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of AN-like behavior and identifying novel treatments."

This paper compares previous studies of this phenomenon in relation to the ambient temperatures (AT) that were employed. On this basis, and from some more direct evidence, we argue that AT is an important, but neglected, factor in activity-based anorexia research. More attention to AT is needed in future research, since its neglect threatens the validity of conclusions drawn from those studies. Furthermore, direct examination of the effect of AT on activity-based anorexia will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the possible clinical implications for the treatment of human anorexia nervosa."

Early indicators are critical for preventive and efficient treatment of progressive psychiatric disorders like anorexia nervosa. Comparable to physical hyperactivity observed in anorexia nervosa patients, in the activity-based anorexia rodent model, mice and rats express paradoxical high voluntary wheel running activity levels when food restricted. Eleven inbred mouse strains and outbred Wistar WU rats were exposed to the activity-based anorexia model in search of identifying susceptibility predictors. Body weight, food intake and wheel running activity levels of each individual mouse and rat were measured. Mouse strains and rats with high wheel running activity levels during food restriction exhibited accelerated body weight loss. Linear mixed models for repeated measures analysis showed that baseline wheel running activity levels preceding the scheduled food restriction phase strongly predicted activity-based anorexia susceptibility (mice: Beta = -0.0158 (±0.003 SE), P<0.0001; rats: Beta = -0.0242 (±0.004 SE), P<0.0001) compared to other baseline parameters. These results suggest that physical activity levels play an important role in activity-based anorexia susceptibility in different rodent species with genetically diverse background. These findings support previous retrospective studies on physical activity levels in anorexia nervosa patients and indicate that pre-morbid physical activity levels could reflect an early indicator for disease severity."
"['van Gestel MA', 'Kostrzewa E', 'Adan RA', 'Janhunen SK.']",Pharmacological manipulations in animal models of anorexia and binge eating in relation to humans.,Br J Pharmacol,"Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorders (BED), are described as abnormal eating habits that usually involve insufficient or excessive food intake. Animal models have been developed that provide insight into certain aspects of eating disorders. Several drugs have been found efficacious in these animal models and some of them have eventually proven useful in the treatment of eating disorders. This review will cover the role of monoaminergic neurotransmitters in eating disorders and their pharmacological manipulations in animal models and humans. Dopamine, 5-HT (serotonin) and noradrenaline in hypothalamic and striatal regions regulate food intake by affecting hunger and satiety and by affecting rewarding and motivational aspects of feeding. Reduced neurotransmission by dopamine, 5-HT and noradrenaline and compensatory changes, at least in dopamine D2 and 5-HT(2C/2A) receptors, have been related to the pathophysiology of AN in humans and animal models. Also, in disorders and animal models of BN and BED, monoaminergic neurotransmission is down-regulated but receptor level changes are different from those seen in AN. A hypofunctional dopamine system or overactive α2-adrenoceptors may contribute to an attenuated response to (palatable) food and result in hedonic binge eating. Evidence for the efficacy of monoaminergic treatments for AN is limited, while more support exists for the treatment of BN or BED with monoaminergic drugs."
"['Yi J', 'Delp MS', 'Gilbert ER', 'Siegel PB', 'Cline MA.']",Anorexia is Associated with Stress-Dependent Orexigenic Responses to Exogenous Neuropeptide Y.,J Neuroendocrinol,"Chicken lines that have been divergently selected for either low (LWS) or high (HWS) body weight at 56 days of age for more than 57 generations have different feeding behaviours in response to a range of i.c.v. injected neurotransmitters. The LWS have different severities of anorexia, whereas the HWS become obese. Previously, we demonstrated that LWS chicks did not respond, whereas HWS chicks increased food intake, after central injection of neuropeptide Y (NPY). The present study aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the loss of orexigenic function of NPY in LWS. Chicks were divided into four groups: stressed LWS and HWS on day of hatch, and control LWS and HWS. The stressor was a combination of food deprivation and cold exposure. On day 5 post-hatch, each chick received an i.c.v. injection of vehicle or 0.2 nmol of NPY. Only the LWS stressed group did not increase food intake in response to i.c.v. NPY. Hypothalamic mRNA abundance of appetite-associated factors was measured at 1 h post-injection. Interactions of genetic line, stress and NPY treatment were observed for the mRNA abundance of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1). Intracerebroventricular injection of NPY decreased and increased AgRP and SYT1 mRNA, respectively, in the stressed LWS and increased AgRP mRNA in stressed HWS chicks. Stress was associated with increased NPY, orexin receptor 2, corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor 1, melanocortin receptor 3 (MC3R) and growth hormone secretagogue receptor expression. In conclusion, the loss of responsiveness to exogenous NPY in stressed LWS chicks may be a result of the decreased and increased hypothalamic expression of AgRP and MC3R, respectively. This may induce an intensification of anorexigenic melanocortin signalling pathways in LWS chicks that block the orexigenic effect of exogenous NPY. These results provide insights onto the anorexic condition across species, and especially for forms of inducible anorexia such as human anorexia nervosa."

Although anandamide is now thought to be a ligand for vanilloid receptor, receptors that are targets of anandamide could play a similar role in eating behaviors and related disorders. This study therefore focused on the receptor, which is called G-protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) that had recently been reported to have binding affinity for endocannabinoids. Functional analysis of the sole missense polymorphism, rs3749073 (Gly195Val) in the GPR55 gene was performed by detecting the phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Chinese-Hamster-Ovary (CHO) cells engineered to express human GPR55. Val195 type GPR55 appeared to induce less phosphorylated ERK than Gly195 type GPR55 when CHO cells were treated with anandamide and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). An association between the functional Gly195Val polymorphism and anorexia nervosa was tested in a female Japanese population comprising 235 patients and 1244 controls. The Val195 allele and homozygote of the Val195 allele were more abundant in the group of patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (P = 0.023, Odds ratio = 1.31 (95% Cl = 1.03-1.37), P = 0.0048, OR = 2.41 (95% Cl = 1.34-4.34), respectively). In conclusion, the low-functioning Val195 allele of GPR55 appears to be a risk factor for anorexia nervosa."

We interrogated whether AgRP neurons are relevant to the emergence of anorexia nervosa symptomatology in a mouse model. Here we show, using in vivo fibre photometry, a rapid inhibition of AgRP neuronal activity following voluntary cessation of running. All AgRP neuron-ablated, food-restricted mice die within 72 h of compulsive running, while daily activation of AgRP neurons using a chemogenetic tool increases voluntary running with no lethality of food-restricted animals. Animals with impaired AgRP neuronal circuits are unable to properly mobilize fuels during food-restriction-associated exercise; however, when provided with elevated fat content through diet, their death is completely prevented. Elevated fat content in the diet also prevents the long-term behavioural impact of food-restricted fit mice with elevated exercise volume. These observations elucidate a previously unsuspected organizational role of AgRP neurons, via the mediation of the periphery, in the regulation of compulsive exercise and its related lethality with possible implications for psychiatric conditions, such as anorexia nervosa."

This is in the context of our auto-addiction model of anorexia nervosa in which endogenous opioids play a critical role in its etiology. Morphine activation of the endogenous opioid systems increases food intake and causes sedation in most species, including normal humans and rats. In contrast in BALB/C mice, morphine causes anorexia and hyperactivity, which we suggest may be true in the anorexia nervosa patient. A variety of atypical opioid systems have been demonstrated in different mouse strains, based on other responses. The present study examines these strains with reference to the responses relevant to our anorexia nervosa model. Three patterns are described--anorexia with hyperactivity (BALB/C and C57BL/6J mice), anorexia without hyperactivity (DBA/J mice), and a biphasic curve with hyperphagia at low doses and anorexia and hyperactivity at higher doses (CF-1 mice). Only female mice were used. These atypical opioid systems may reflect a spectrum of biological predispositions to the disorder. These strain differences may also provide useful correlations of the genetic determinants of various opiate responses and provide useful comparisons in characterizing the essential features responsible for the atypical responses."

"['Gat-Yablonski G', 'Pando R', 'Phillip M.']",Nutritional catch-up growth.,World Rev Nutr Diet,"Malnutrition, marked by variant nutrient deficiencies, is considered a leading cause of stunted growth worldwide. In developing countries, malnutrition is caused mainly by food shortage and infectious diseases. Malnutrition may also be found in the developed world, where it is due mostly to prematurity, chronic diseases, and anorexia nervosa. In most cases, when food consumption is corrected, spontaneous catch-up (CU) growth occurs. However, CU growth is not always complete, leading to growth deficits. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms that govern this process. Using a rat model of food restriction followed by refeeding, we established a nutrition-induced CU growth model. Levels of leptin and insulin-like growth factor-1 were found to significantly decrease when food was restricted and to increase already 1 day after refeeding. Gene expression analysis of the growth plate revealed that food restriction specifically affects transcription factors such as the hypoxia inducible factor-1 and its downstream targets on the one hand, and global gene expression, indicating epigenetic regulation, on the other. Food restriction also reduced the level of several microRNAs, including the chondrocyte-specific miR-140, which led to an increase in its target, SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase. These findings may explain the global changes in gene expression observed under nutritional manipulation. We suggest that multiple levels of regulation, including transcription factors, epigenetic mechanisms, and microRNAs respond to nutritional cues and offer a possible explanation for some of the effects of food restriction on epiphyseal growth plate growth. The means whereby these components sense changes in nutritional status are still unknown. Deciphering the role of epigenetic regulation in growth may pave the way for the development of new treatments for children with growth disorders."
"['Veldhuis-Vlug AG', 'Rosen CJ.']",Clinical implications of bone marrow adiposity.,J Intern Med,"Marrow adipocytes, collectively termed marrow adipose tissue (MAT), reside in the bone marrow in close contact to bone cells and haematopoietic cells. Marrow adipocytes arise from the mesenchymal stem cell and share their origin with the osteoblast. Shifts in the lineage allocation of the mesenchymal stromal cell could potentially explain the association between increased MAT and increased fracture risk in diseases such as postmenopausal osteoporosis, anorexia nervosa and diabetes. Functionally, marrow adipocytes secrete adipokines, such as adiponectin, and cytokines, such as RANK ligand and stem cell factor. These mediators can influence both bone remodelling and haematopoiesis by promoting bone resorption and haematopoietic recovery following chemotherapy. In addition, marrow adipocytes can secrete free fatty acids, acting as a energy supply for bone and haematopoietic cells. However, this induced lipolysis is also used by neoplastic cells to promote survival and proliferation. Therefore, MAT could represent a new therapeutic target for multiple diseases from osteoporosis to leukaemia, although the exact characteristics and role of the marrow adipocyte in health and diseases remain to be determined."

Patients with AN invariably have a disturbed body image and an intense fear of weight gain. There is currently no definitive treatment for this disease, which carries a 20% mortality over 20 years. Development of an appropriate animal model of AN has been difficult, as the etiology of this eating disorder likely involves a complex interaction between genetic, environmental, social, and cultural factors. In this review, we focus on several possible rodent models of AN. In our laboratory, we have developed and studied three different mouse models of AN based on clinical profiles of the disease; separation stress, activity, and diet restriction (DR). In addition, we discuss the spontaneous mouse mutation anx/anx and several mouse gene knockout models, which have resulted in an anorexic phenotype. We highlight what has been learned from each of these models and possibilities for future models. It is hoped that a combination of the study of such models, together with genetic and clinical studies in patients, will lead to more rational and successful prevention/treatment of this tragic, and often fatal, disease."

      To test the effect of raising ambient temperature (AT) on activity-based anorexia (ABA) and to extend to female rats previous findings reported in male animals.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Two studies are reported in which female rats were submitted to food restriction and free access to an activity wheel either separately or in combination under changing (21-32 °C) or constant AT (21 °C).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Warming ABA animals reversed running activity, preserved food-intake, and enabled female rats to recover from acute weight loss. Moreover, sedentary food-restricted warmed rats maintained a body weight equivalent to the levels of animals housed at standard AT in spite of 20% reduced food-intake.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The replication on female rats corroborates the effect previously reported for males, which is indicative of the robust effect of AT in recovering rats from ABA. The findings reported here represent strong preclinical evidence in favor of heat supply as a useful adjunctive component for the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN)."

Recent studies with physiological, track-tracing, optogenetic and electrophysiological recording experiments indicate that a group of kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus are responsible for pulsatile GnRH release.

Most of the studies, including meta-analysis, have yielded negative results; only a single positive finding has been replicated independently. Recently, systematic genome-wide scans based on families with two or more individuals with an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa) revealed initial linkage regions on chromosomes 1, 3, and 4 (anorexia nervosa) and 10p (bulimia nervosa). Fine mapping of one of these regions led to the identification of genes where an association with anorexia nervosa was detected.

Several approaches have been used to accomplish this, each with benefits and drawbacks. In this article, we survey the four most common methods for measuring food intake in rodents: manual weighing of food, automated weighing scales, pellet dispensers, and video-based analyses.

The pathophysiology of AN and the involvement of food intake-regulatory peptides is still poorly understood. Nesfatin-1, an anorexigenic peptide also involved in the mediation of stress, anxiety and depression might be a likely candidate involved in the pathogenesis of AN. Therefore, activation of nesfatin-1 immunoreactive (ir) brain nuclei was investigated under conditions of ABA. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were used and divided into four groups (n=6/group): activity-based anorexia (ABA), restricted feeding (RF), activity (AC) and ad libitum fed (AL). After the 21-day experimental period and development of ABA, brains were processed for c-Fos/nesfatin-1 double labeling immunohistochemistry. ABA increased the number of nesfatin-1 immunopositive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus, arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, locus coeruleus and in the rostral part of the nucleus of the solitary tract compared to AL and AC groups (p<0.05) but not to RF rats (p>0.05). Moreover, we observed significantly more c-Fos and nesfatin-1 ir double-labeled cells in ABA rats compared to RF, AL and AC in the supraoptic nucleus (p<0.05) and compared to AL and AC in the paraventricular nucleus, arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus and the rostral raphe pallidus (p<0.05). Since nesfatin-1 plays a role in the inhibition of food intake and the response to stress, we hypothesize that the observed changes of brain nesfatin-1 might play a role in the pathophysiology and symptomatology under conditions of ABA and potentially also in patients with AN."

      Activity-based anorexia (ABA) in rodents is a behavioral model of anorexia nervosa, characterized by negative energy balance, hyperactivity, and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Gut bacteria are known to produce energy substrates including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and acetate. The aim of this study was to determine whether ABA alters the proteome of gut microbiota relevant to ATP and acetate production.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The ABA was developed in male mice and compared with food-restricted and ad libitum-fed conditions. Proteomic analysis of feces was performed using the two-dimentional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The in vitro ATP-producing capacity of proteins extracted from feces was assayed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Increased levels of the phosphoglycerate kinase, an ATP-producing glycolytic enzyme, was detected in feces of food-restricted mice and this enzyme was further increased in the ABA group. Starvation also upregulated several other proteins synthetized by order Clostridiales including Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae families. No significant differences in the in vitro ATP-producing capacity by bacterial proteins from ABA, food-restricted, and ad libitum-fed control mice were found. However, plasma levels of acetate strongly tended to be increased in the activity groups including ABA mice.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The data revealed that starvation in food-restricted and ABA mice induced proteome modification in gut bacteria favoring ATP production mainly by the order Clostridiales. However, this did not result in increased total ATP-production capacity by gut microbiota. These changes can be interpreted as an adaptation of specific gut bacteria to the host malnutrition beneficial for host survival."

Observations from animal models of diabetes and hypertension suggest that the combination of exercise and caloric restriction may exert greater neuroprotection in the hippocampus than either behavior alone. Yet, in humans, the effects of exercise and caloric restriction on the hippocampus are not known. We measured the volume of the hippocampus prior to clinical treatment in women with anorexia nervosa (AN) who were restricting calories and engaging in excessive exercise, women with AN who did not exercise excessively, and healthy women who did not engage in either behavior. Women with AN were also examined longitudinally (once weight was restored and 6 months later). In the present report, we found that women with AN engaged in caloric restriction and excessive exercising prior to clinical treatment had larger hippocampal volumes than healthy comparison women. After weight restoration, women with AN who had engaged in food restriction and excessive exercise prior to treatment had hippocampal volumes similar to that of women with AN who only engaged in caloric restriction. These results advance the field by showing for the first time that hippocampal volume may be increased by exercise alone or exercise interacting with food restriction in AN."

Activity-Based Anorexia (ABA) model combines physical activity (PA) and reduced food intake and thus allows a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying anorexia nervosa. We aimed to assess sex differences in response to ABA model in C57Bl/6 mice. Twenty four male and 16 female C57BL/6 mice were studied. ABA mice were placed in individual cages with a continuously recorded activity wheel. ABA mice had a progressive limited food access from 6h/day (day 6) to 3h/day (day 9) until the end of the protocol (day 17). Body weight and food intake were daily measured. We studied physical activity during 24h, during the dark phase (D-PA) and the light phase (L-PA). We also evaluated the feeding anticipatory physical activity (A-PA), the physical activity during food intake period (FI-PA) and the post-prandial physical activity (PP-PA). We observed 16.7% of mortality in males (4 out of 24 mice) during ABA protocol while no female mice died (p=0.09). At day 17, food intake was significantly higher in females than in males (p<0.05) that was associated with a lower body weight loss than in females (p<0.05). Before limited food access, no gender differences in wheel running activity were observed. From day 9, A-PA significantly increased over time in males (p<0.05 vs females) while females exhibited higher FI-PA and PP-PA (p<0.05 vs males). Correlations between wheel running activities and, respectively, food intake and body weight loss showed gender differences, in particularly for L-PA and A-PA. Our results suggest a greater susceptibility of male mice to develop ABA, males and females exhibit different patterns of physical activity after limitation of food access. Underlying mechanisms should be further investigated."

Female rats with a running wheel lost more weight than sedentary rats and ran progressively more as the availability of food was gradually reduced. When food was available for only 1h/day, the rats lost control over body weight. Correlatively, the level of NPY mRNA was increased in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. This phenomenon, activity-based-anorexia, was enhanced by intracerebroventricular infusion of NPY in rats which had food available during 2h/day. By contrast, NPY stimulated food intake but not wheel running in rats which had food available continuously. These findings are inconsistent with the prevailing theory of the role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of body weight according to which food intake is a homeostatic process controlled by ""orexigenic"" and ""anorexigenic"" neural networks. However, the finding that treatment with NPY, generally considered an ""orexigen"", can increase physical activity and decrease food intake and cause a loss of body weight is in line with the clinical observation that patients with anorexia nervosa are physically hyperactive and eat only little food despite having depleted body fat and up-regulated hypothalamic ""orexigenic"" peptides."

Probably, the most outlined example is the association between hyperactivity and anorexia in Anorexia nervosa. The neural underpinnings of this 'paradox', however, are poorly elucidated. Although anorexia and hyperactivity prevail over self-preservation, both symptoms rarely exist independently, suggesting commonalities in neural pathways, most likely in the reward system. We previously discovered an addictive molecular facet of anorexia, involving production, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), of the same transcripts stimulated in response to cocaine and amphetamine (CART) upon stimulation of the 5-HT(4) receptors (5-HTR(4)) or MDMA (ecstasy). Here, we tested whether this pathway predisposes not only to anorexia but also to hyperactivity. Following food restriction, mice are expected to overeat. However, selecting hyperactive and addiction-related animal models, we observed that mice lacking 5-HTR(1B) self-imposed food restriction after deprivation and still displayed anorexia and hyperactivity after ecstasy. Decryption of the mechanisms showed a gain-of-function of 5-HTR(4) in the absence of 5-HTR(1B), associated with CART surplus in the NAc and not in other brain areas. NAc-5-HTR(4) overexpression upregulated NAc-CART, provoked anorexia and hyperactivity. NAc-5-HTR(4) knockdown or blockade reduced ecstasy-induced hyperactivity. Finally, NAc-CART knockdown suppressed hyperactivity upon stimulation of the NAc-5-HTR(4). Additionally, inactivating NAc-5-HTR(4) suppressed ecstasy's preference, strengthening the rewarding facet of anorexia. In conclusion, the NAc-5-HTR(4)/CART pathway establishes a 'tight-junction' between anorexia and hyperactivity, suggesting the existence of a primary functional unit susceptible to limit overeating associated with resting following homeostasis rules."

A second wave of targets came from basic research, enabled by the low morbidity, reversibility, and adaptability of DBS. This was the case for the subthalamic nucleus (STN) which improves the triad of dopaminergic symptoms, and the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) for gait disorders in PD.

Serendipity and a scientific approach have provided several instances where targets have produced unexpected effects (such as STN in OCD), as well as limbic effects observed during attempts at VMH stimulation for obesity: this might offer a novel way to treat mild cognitive impairment, or memory deficits reported in Alzheimer's disease.

The activity-based anorexia (ABA) paradigm is an animal model in which rodents exposed to both running wheels and scheduled feeding develop aspects of AN including paradoxical hypophagia, dramatic weight loss, and hyperactivity, while animals exposed to only one condition maintain normal body weight. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an activity-dependent modulator of neuronal plasticity, is reduced in the serum of AN patients, and is a known regulator of feeding and weight maintenance. We assessed the effects of scheduled feeding, running wheel access, or both on the expression of BDNF transcripts within the mesocorticolimbic pathway. We also assessed the expression of neuronal cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) to explore the specificity of effects on BDNF within the mesocorticolimbic pathway. Scheduled feeding increased the levels of both transcripts in the hippocampus (HPC), increased NCAM1 mRNA expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and decreased BDNF mRNA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In addition, wheel running increased BDNF mRNA expression in the VTA. No changes in either transcript were observed in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Furthermore, no changes in either transcript were induced by the combined scheduled feeding and wheel access condition. These data indicate that scheduled feeding or wheel running alter BDNF and NCAM1 expression levels in specific regions of the mesocorticolimbic pathway. These findings contribute to our current knowledge of the molecular alterations induced by ABA and may help elucidate possible mechanisms of AN pathology."

We used activity-based anorexia (ABA) model to investigate the role of TLR4 and its contribution in anorexia-associated low-grade inflammation. Here, we found that ABA affected early the intestinal inflammatory status and the hypothalamic response. Indeed, TLR4 was upregulated both on colonic epithelial cells and intestinal macrophages, leading to elevated downstream mucosal cytokine production. These mucosal changes occurred earlier than hypothalamic changes driving to increased levels of IL-1β and IL-1R1 as well as increased levels of plasma corticosterone. Paradoxically, TLR4-deficient mice exhibited greater vulnerability to ABA with increased mortality rate, suggesting a major contribution of TLR4-mediated responses during ABA-induced weight loss."

The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was recently shown to reduce both AN symptoms and ABA. We examined which component of the complex pharmacological profile of olanzapine reduces ABA. Mice received 5-HT(2A/2C), 5-HT3, dopamine D1-like, D2, D3 or D2/3 antagonist treatment, and were assessed for food intake, body weight, wheel running and survival in ABA. D2/3 receptor antagonists eticlopride and amisulpride reduced weight loss and hypophagia, and increased survival during ABA. Furthermore, amisulpride produced larger reductions in weight loss and hypophagia than olanzapine. Treatment with either D3 receptor antagonist SB277011A or D2 receptor antagonist L-741,626 also increased survival. All the other treatments either had no effect or worsened ABA.

Clinical and preclinical research is constantly adding new information to the field and orienting further studies with the aim of providing a foundation for developing more specific and effective treatment approaches to pathological conditions. A recent symposium at the XVI Congress of the Societá Italiana di Neuroscienze (SINS, 2015) 'Eating disorders: from bench to bedside and back' brought together basic scientists and clinicians with the objective of presenting novel perspectives in the neurobiology of eating disorders. Clinical studies presented by V. Ricca illustrated some genetic aspects of the psychopathology of anorexia nervosa. Preclinical studies addressed different issues ranging from the description of animal models that mimic human pathologies such as anorexia nervosa, diet-induced obesity, and binge eating disorders (T. Lutz), to novel interactions between peripheral signals and central circuits that govern food intake, mood and stress (A. Romano and G. Provensi). The gut-brain axis has received increasing attention in the recent years as preclinical studies are demonstrating that the brain and visceral organs such as the liver and guts, but also the microbiota are constantly engaged in processes of reciprocal communication, with unexpected physiological and pathological implications. Eating is controlled by a plethora of factors; genetic predisposition, early life adverse conditions, peripheral gastrointestinal hormones that act directly or indirectly on the central nervous system, all are receiving attention as they presumably contribute to the development of eating disorders."

As such, it would be amenable to medical treatment drawing from forty years of research in animals. This hypothesis is testable. For instance, since food ad libitum is a prerequisite for PIPD, occasional supervised fasting in healthy peripuberal subjects should prevent AN. Besides, tolerating an untestable thought disease (1,2) with symptoms of a curable well-understood animal condition would be anti-scientific and perpetuates medical disaster. Even their endocrinologies are identical. Pheromone feedback tunes animal appetites and immunity to available resources and prospects. In addition to timing puberty, pheromones regulate fertility. Pheromones will probably be implicated in the aetiology of the psychiatric and autoimmune diseases. This is the second in a series of twelve papers to explore this contention systematically."

Conversely, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-gamma, contribute to the receptor resistance of neuropeptides, reduce the availability of amino acids which are needed for the synthesis of neurotransmitters or show neurotoxic effects. Other cytokines like granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be highly attractive candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. Cytokines are decisively involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia or anorexia nervosa as well as in neurological, respectively neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. This connection between the immune system and the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders leads to the concept that immunomodulatory drugs which are already in use for various diseases related to the immune system may also be efficient in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

To investigate in depth the characteristics of FAA, we retrospectively analyzed the level of FAA and activities during other periods in ABA rats.

On the contrary, our study shows that postprandial activities are more directly related to weight loss. We conclude that FAA alone may not be sufficient to reflect model severity, and activities during other periods may be of potential value in studies using ABA model."

      Anorexia nervosa, a restrictive eating disorder, is often associated with gastrointestinal disorders, particularly a delayed gastric emptying. However, the mechanisms remained poorly documented. Thus, we aimed to evaluate gastric emptying and antrum protein metabolism in the Activity-Based Anorexia model (ABA).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Females C57Bl/6 mice were randomized into 3 groups: Control, ABA, and Limited Food Access (LFA). Food access has been progressively limited from 6 h/day at day 6 to 3 h/day at day 9 and until day 17. ABA mice had free access to an activity wheel. Gastric emptying was assessed. On gastric extracts, a proteomic analysis was performed, as well as an evaluation of protein synthesis and protein oxidation.
    


          Key results:
        
      
      Both LFA and ABA mice exhibited a delayed gastric emptying compared with Controls (P < .05). Proteomic approach revealed 15 proteins that were differentially expressed. Among these proteins, we identified 2 clusters of interest contributing to (i) the organization of muscle fiber with ACTA2, VCL, KRT19, KRT8, and DES proteins and (ii) ""heat shock proteins"" with STIP1, HSPD1, and HSPA8 proteins. ABA mice specifically exhibited an increased rate of gastric oxidized proteins.
    


          Conclusions and inferences:
        
      
      Delayed gastric emptying observed in anorectic conditions appears to be secondary to malnutrition. However, an oxidative stress is specifically present in the stomach of ABA mice. Its role remains to be further studied."

      Anorexia nervosa (AN) patients often show extreme hypophagia and excessive physical activity. Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is considered an animal model of AN and mimics food restriction and hyperactivity in rats. This study investigated whether treatment with olanzapine (Zyprexa) reduces the development of ABA in rats. The effect of olanzapine treatment in AN patients was also evaluated in a small open-label study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Rats were chronically (1 week) infused with olanzapine (7.5 mg/kg) and exposed to the ABA model or ad libitum feeding. Hyperactive AN patients were followed for up to 3 months of olanzapine treatment (5 mg/kg).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Olanzapine treatment reduced development of ABA in rats by reducing running wheel activity, starvation-induced hypothermia and activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Olanzapine treatment reduced activity levels of AN patients compared with untreated AN patients, without affecting body weight and plasma leptin levels.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Olanzapine treatment reduced wheel running and thereby diminished development of ABA in rats. Olanzapine treatment also reduced physical activity in hyperactive AN patients in a small open-label study. These data support the need for controlled studies investigating the putative beneficial effects of olanzapine treatment in AN patients."
['Strasser F.'],Clinical application of ghrelin.,Curr Pharm Des,"Ghrelin as a human natural hormone is involved in fundamental regulatory processes of eating and energy balance. Ghrelin signals the nutrient availability from the gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system, up-regulates food intake and lowers energy expenditure mainly through hypothalamic mediators acting both centrally and peripherally including the gastrointestinal tract (motility, epithelium), promotes both neuro-endocrine and inflammatory signals to increase skeletal muscle growth and decrease protein breakdown, and increases lipolysis while body fat utilization is reduced. Ghrelin does more to exert its probably sentinel role around ""human energy"": it influences through mainly extra-hypothalamic actions the hedonic and incentive value of food, mood and anxiety, sleep-wake regulation, learning and memory, and neurogenesis. Recently numerous ghrelin gene-derived peptides were discovered, demonstrating the complexity within the ghrelin/ghrelin receptor axis. For clinical applications, not only the natural ghrelin and its slice variants, but also several modified or artificial molecules acting at ghrelin-associated receptors were and are developed. Current clinical applications are limited to clinical studies, focusing mainly on cachexia in chronic heart failure, COPD, cancer, endstage- renal-disease or cystic fibrosis, but also on frailty in elderly, gastrointestinal motility (e.g., gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, postoperative ileus), after curative gastrectomy, anorexia nervosa, growth hormone deficient patients, alcohol craving, sleep-wake regulation (e.g. major depression), or sympathetic nervous activity in obesity. The results of completed, preliminary studies support the clinical potential of ghrelin, ghrelin gene-derived peptides, and artificial analogues, suggesting that larger clinical trials are demanded to move ghrelin towards an available and reimbursed pharmaceutical intervention."
"['Hinney A', 'Remschmidt H', 'Hebebrand J.']",Candidate gene polymorphisms in eating disorders.,Eur J Pharmacol,"Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are complex disorders characterized by disordered eating behaviour. Attitudes towards weight and shape as well as the perception of body shape are disturbed. A substantial genetic influence on these disorders has been suggested by formal genetic studies. Obsessive-compulsive behaviour, perfectionism and anxious personality traits seem to occur premorbidly in several patients. Disturbances of neurotransmitter, neuropeptide and neuroendocrine systems have been reported in acutely ill and followed-up patients. Hence, these systems might be involved in the etiology of these eating disorders.Genetic studies on candidate genes have mainly focussed on the serotonergic system and on genes involved in body weight regulation. Up to now, polymorphisms and variations in various genes (e.g. genes for 5-HT receptors, leptin gene, melanocortin MC(4) receptor gene) have been assessed for association and transmission disequilibrium pertaining to anorexia nervosa and/or bulimia nervosa. Most of the studies yielded negative results. Four studies of a polymorphism (-1438 G/A) within the promoter of the 5-HT(2A) gene (5-HT(2A)) revealed an association of the A-allele to anorexia nervosa. However, three studies could not confirm this result. Furthermore, a meta-analysis did not support the positive association. Currently, combined efforts within the European Union will answer the question of whether or not the A-allele is involved in the predisposition to anorexia nervosa. A transmission disequilibrium test is being performed in about 300 trios consisting of a patient with anorexia nervosa and both parents. As candidate gene approaches did not unequivocally identify susceptibility genes (alleles) for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, systematic model-free genome-wide screenings should also be performed in order to identify currently unknown genes involved in eating disorders. This kind of approach has already been initiated for anorexia nervosa. Genetic research on eating disorders will hopefully lead to new pharmacological treatment strategies."

Bone is no exception to this, and the benefit of remodeling when necessary outweighs the energy costs. Bone remodeling is important for maintaining blood calcium homeostasis, repairing micro cracks and fractures, and modifying bone structure so that it is better suited to withstand loading demands. Osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes are the primary cells responsible for bone remodeling, although bone marrow adipocytes and other cells may also play an indirect role. There is a renewed interest in bone cell energetics because of the potential for these processes to be targeted for osteoporosis therapies. In contrast, due to the intimate link between bone and energy homeostasis, pharmaceuticals that treat metabolic disease or have metabolic side effects often have deleterious bone consequences. In this brief review, we will introduce osteoporosis, discuss how bone cells utilize energy to function, evidence for bone regulating whole body energy homeostasis, and some of the unanswered questions and opportunities for further research in the field."

We present here the translation of this approach to C57/BL6 mice, a common background for genetically modified mice, and investigate the effects of the cannabinoid agonist, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the endocannabinoid uptake inhibitor, OMDM-2 in this model. The ABA paradigm was optimised so that food-restricted wheel-running mice displayed anorexia, reduced body weight and disrupted activity and circadian cycles. These conditions produced a murine ABA model with a defined stage and stability to allow for pharmacological intervention. Daily Delta(9)-THC (0.5 mg/kg) decreased survival in the ABA animals but increased feeding in the survivors, OMDM-2 (3 mg/kg) increased food intake, but not sufficiently to reverse weight loss. The effects of this model on endocannabinoid tone in the brain remain to be determined. Since the endocannabinoid system may be implicated in anorexia nervosa and in view of the positive modulation by cannabinoids of some aspects of ABA in this study, further investigation of the effects of cannabinoids in ABA is warranted."

A biological predisposition may result from an atypical endogenous opioid system. Morphine activation of the system increases food intake in most species, including normal humans and rats, but decreases food intake in mice. The atypical opioid system in mice may be representative of that in anorexia nervosa patients, causing the biological predisposition. Anorexia nervosa is 10 times more prevalent in females than males. In the context of this auto-addiction opioid model, it was interesting to determine if the effects of morphine on food intake were markedly different between the two sexes. Full dose-response curves were done of the effects of morphine on food intake in males and females in both rats and mice, representing the typical and atypical responses, respectively. Differences between the sexes were not found to explain the marked prevalence of anorexia nervosa for females. The marked preference is probably at some other step."

While the ABA effect is well established, the distinct functions of exercise and food restriction in maintaining ABA have not been determined. The current study examined the effect of pre-exposure to a restricted feeding schedule and pre-exposure to a running wheel on the incidence of ABA in 36 rats. Access to food and the running wheel was also varied in the recovery phase of the study in order to establish the effect of these variables on recovery from ABA. Three adaptation conditions (pre-exposed to food restriction, pre-exposed to wheel access and non-exposed) and two recovery conditions (wheel access and food restriction recovery) defined the six groups in the current study. Pre-exposure to food restriction was found to ameliorate the ABA effect during the anorexia phase while pre-exposure to wheel access exacerbated ABA. It was also found that subjects in the wheel access recovery condition gained more weight than the subjects in the food restriction recovery. In food restriction recovery, there was an interaction between the adaptation and recovery condition, with subjects that were pre-exposed to food restriction gaining the most weight. The results of the current study aid in understanding the distinct functions of food restriction and exercise in maintaining and recovering from ABA and have possible implications for the treatment of people diagnosed with some types of anorexia nervosa."

We assessed anxiety-like and locomotor behavior and hyperactivity with the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Our results showed that ABA rats of both sexes displayed hyperactive behavior associated with reduced anxiety-like behavior when compared to controls. However, a sexually dimorphic effect of MS emerged in anorexic rats: while the females exposed to MS + ABA were hyperactive with diminished anxiety-related behaviors compared to females of the ABA group, MS in males attenuated or did not alter the effects of the ABA protocol. In conclusion, our data reveal that the synergistic effects of MS and ABA on physical activity and anxiety-like behavior act in opposite directions in the two sexes."

Robust, quantitative analyses are vital for studying these differences. In this Commentary we highlight two articles from our lab that employ sensitive new methods in zebrafish capable of delineating complex and quantitative adiposity phenotypes. In the first article, we utilized in vivo imaging to systematically quantify zebrafish adipose tissues. We identified 34 regionally distinct zebrafish adipose tissues and developed statistical models to predict the size and variance of each adipose tissue over the course of zebrafish growth. We then employed these models to identify effects of strain and diet on adipose tissue growth. In the second article, we employed deep phenotyping to study complex disease-related adiposity traits. Using this methodology, we identified that adipose tissues have unique capacities to re-deposit lipid following food restriction and re-feeding. These distinct re-deposition potentials led to widespread fat distribution changes following re-feeding. We discuss how these novel findings may provide relevance to health conditions such as anorexia nervosa. Together, the strategies described in these two articles can be used as unbiased and quantitative methods to uncover new relationships between genotype, diet and adiposity."

Decreased plasma adiponectin levels were reported in insulin-resistant states, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes and in patients with coronary artery disease. Activity of adiponectin is associated with leptin, resistin and with steroid and thyroid hormones, glucocorticoids, NO and others.

['Nonogaki K.'],Ghrelin and feedback systems.,Vitam Horm,"Ghrelin is produced primarily in the stomach in response to hunger, and circulates in the blood. Plasma ghrelin levels increase during fasting and decrease after ingesting glucose and lipid, but not protein. The efferent vagus nerve contributes to the fasting-induced increase in ghrelin secretion. Ghrelin secreted by the stomach stimulates the afferent vagus nerve and promotes food intake. Ghrelin also stimulates pituitary gland secretion of growth hormone (GH) via the afferent vagus nerve. GH inhibits stomach ghrelin secretion. These findings indicate that the vagal circuit between the central nervous system and stomach has a crucial role in regulating plasma ghrelin levels. Moreover, body mass index modulates plasma ghrelin levels. In a lean state and anorexia nervosa, plasma ghrelin levels are increased, whereas in obesity, except in Prader-Willi syndrome, plasma ghrelin levels are decreased and the feeding- and sleeping-induced decline in plasma ghrelin levels is disrupted. There are two forms of ghrelin: active n-octanoyl-modified ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin. Fasting increases both ghrelin types compared with the fed state. Hyperphagia and obesity are likely to decrease plasma des-acyl ghrelin, but not n-octanoyl-modified ghrelin levels. Hypothalamic serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 and serotonin 5-HT2C/1B receptor gene expression levels are likely to be proportional to plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels during fasting, whereas they are likely to be inversely proportional to plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in an increased energy storage state such as obesity. Thus, a dysfunction of the ghrelin feedback systems might contribute to the pathophysiology of obesity and eating disorders."

      Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is considered an animal model of anorexia nervosa (AN). In ABA, scheduled feeding together with voluntary access to a running wheel results in increased running wheel activity (RWA), hypophagia, and body weight loss. Previously it was shown that leptin treatment reduced semi-starvation-induced hyperactivity in rats. The present study was performed to confirm and extend this finding, to evaluate leptin's effect on energy balance in ABA.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The effects of chronic leptin treatment (intracerebroventricular, 4 microg/day) in ABA rats, ad libitum-fed running rats, and sedentary rats exposed to ad libitum feeding or scheduled feeding were investigated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Leptin treatment decreased RWA in ABA rats. Additionally, leptin treatment reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure by thermogenesis in ABA rats. Ad libitum-fed running/sedentary rats or food-restricted sedentary rats did not reduce activity after leptin treatment, whereas all leptin-treated rats showed hypophagia. Body temperature was slightly increased in leptin-treated food-restricted sedentary rats.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although leptin treatment reduced RWA in ABA rats, it also prevented hypothermia and decreased food intake. Altogether, this resulted in a stronger negative energy balance and body weight loss in leptin-treated ABA rats."

      The recently identified myokine, irisin has raised great expectations as a potential target in the conservative treatment of obesity. This review focuses on studies exploring the effects of irisin in humans.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 α expression in skeletal muscles is induced by exercise followed by expression of the membrane protein fibronectin type III domain containing 5. After cleavage from fibronectin type III domain containing 5, irisin is secreted into blood increasing thermogenesis by browning of subcutaneous white/beige adipose tissue. Although clear-cut data have been reported in rodents, the thermogenic effect of irisin in humans remains controversial. The initially reported exercise-dependent increase of irisin in humans could not be confirmed in most studies. However, a robust finding in human studies is the association of irisin with BMI.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The discovery of irisin provides more insight into exercise-induced browning of adipose tissue, and therefore leads to a better understanding of mechanisms underlying body weight regulation and further down the road possibly may lead to treatment strategies of diseases with greatly altered body weight such as obesity or anorexia nervosa."

Ghrelin, a hunger hormone, is one of the candidate for pharmacological treatments of anorexia, but because of its instability in plasma has limited efficacy. We previously showed that plasmatic IgG protect ghrelin from degradation and that IgG from obese subjects and mice may increase ghrelin׳s orexigenic effect. In this study we tested if ghrelin alone or combined with IgG may improve feeding in chronically food-restricted mice with or without physical activity-based anorexia (ABA) induced by free access to a running wheel. Mice received a single daily intraperitoneal injection of ghrelin (1nM) together or not with total IgG (1nM) from obese ob/ob or lean mice before access to food during 8 days of 3h/day feeding time. We found that both ghrelin and ghrelin combined with IgG from obese, but not lean mice, prevented ABA, however, they were not able to diminish body weight loss. Physical activity was lower during the feeding period and was increased shortly after feeding in mice receiving ghrelin together with IgG from obese mice. In food-restricted mice without ABA, ghrelin treatments did not have significant effects on food intake. Thus, this study supports pharmacological use of ghrelin or ghrelin combined with IgG from obese animals for treatment of anorexia accompanied by elevated physical activity. The utility of combining ghrelin with protective IgG should be further determined in animal models of anorexia with unrestricted access to food."

There is no accepted pharmacological treatment for AN, and AN has the highest mortality rate among psychiatric illnesses. Anorexia nervosa most commonly affects females during adolescence, suggesting an effect of sex and hormones on vulnerability to the disease. Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is a rodent model of AN that shares symptoms with AN, including over-exercise, elevation of stress hormones, and genetic links to anxiety traits. We previously reported that ABA in adolescent female rats results in increased apical dendritic branching in CA1 pyramidal cells of the ventral hippocampus at postnatal day 44 (P44). To examine the long-term effects of adolescent ABA (P44) in female rats, we compared the apical branching in the ventral hippocampal CA1 after recovery from ABA (P51) and after a relapse of ABA (P55) with age-matched controls. To examine the age-dependence of the hippocampal plasticity, we examined the effect of ABA during adulthood (P67). We found that while ABA at P44 resulted in increased branching of ventral hippocampal pyramidal cells, relapse of ABA at P55 resulted in decreased branching. ABA induced during adulthood did not have an effect on dendritic branching, suggesting an age-dependence of the vulnerability to structural plasticity. Cells from control animals were found to exhibit a dramatic increase in branching, more than doubling from P44 to P51, followed by pruning from P51 to P55. The proportion of mature spines on dendrites from the P44-ABA animals is similar to that on dendrites from P55-CON animals. These results suggest that the experience of ABA may cause precocious anatomical development of the ventral hippocampus. Importantly, we found that adolescence is a period of continued development of the hippocampus, and increased vulnerability to mental disorders during adolescence may be due to insults during this developmentally critical period."

      Bone loss in anorexia nervosa and following bariatric surgery is associated with an elevated circulating concentration of the gastrointestinal, anorexigenic hormone, peptide YY (PYY). Selective deletion of the PYY receptor Y1R in osteoblasts or Y2R in the hypothalamus results in high bone mass, but deletion of PYY in mice has resulted in conflicting skeletal phenotypes leading to uncertainty regarding its role in the regulation of bone mass. As PYY analogs are under development for treatment of obesity, we aimed to clarify the relationship between PYY and bone mass.

          Results:
        
      
      Bones from juvenile and Pyy KO mice were longer (P < 0.001), with decreased bone mineral content (P < 0.001). Whereas, bones from adult Pyy KO mice had increased bone mineral content (P < 0.05) with increased mineralisation of both cortical (P < 0.001) and trabecular (P < 0.001) compartments. Long bones from adult Pyy KO mice were stronger (maximum load P < 0.001), with increased stiffness (P < 0.01) and toughness (P < 0.05) compared to wild-type (WT) control mice despite increased cortical vascularity and porosity (P < 0.001). The increased bone mass and strength in Pyy KO mice resulted from increases in trabecular (P < 0.01) and cortical bone formation (P < 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These findings demonstrate that PYY acts as a negative regulator of osteoblastic bone formation, implicating increased PYY levels in the pathogenesis of bone loss during anorexia or following bariatric surgery."

Nine adolescent Wistar female rats received a baseline 18FDG scan. The control group received free access to food for a period of 25 days. The food restricted (FR) group received 40% of their baseline daily food intake until a 30% weight loss occurred; body weight was then maintained at 70% of baseline by adjusting daily food intake. The FR group also had free access to a running wheel for a mean period of 10.8+/-6.1 days. Both groups received a follow-up 18FDG scan. Relative 18FDG uptake was significantly increased in the cerebellum and significantly decreased in the hippocampus and striatum in the FR group compared to controls. Moreover, there was a trend towards a decrease in relative 18FDG uptake in the thalamus in the FR compared to control group.

      Disturbances in gastrointestinal hormones have been implicated in the pathogenesis of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. However, the contribution of these hormonal changes to the onset and maintenance of eating disorder remains unclear. We focus our review on a selective number of gastrointestinal hormones that are known to play a role in the regulation of short-term or long-term energy balance and examine their association with eating disorder in recently published literature.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Several new studies reported differential changes of ghrelin isoforms during fasting and following nutrient ingestion. New findings on other appetite-regulating hormones (peptide YY, cholecystokinin, incretin hormones and pancreatic polypeptide) at different nutritional states and disease stage have also been reported in subtypes of eating disorder. Most of the changes in peripheral hormones disappeared or partially recovered after the restoration of weight with nutritional and behavioral therapy.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Dysregulation of gastrointestinal hormones is more likely to contribute to the maintenance of the disordered eating behavior and related metabolic outcomes as well as the clinical course rather than causing them. A better understanding of this relationship also carries implications for developing targeted hormone-base treatment for eating disorder."

A dose-response curve of chronic treatment with the non-selective dopaminergic antagonist cis-flupenthixol was determined in the ABA model. Treatment reduced activity levels in both ad libitum fed and food-restricted rats. Treated ABA rats reduced body weight loss and increased food intake. These data support a role for dopamine in anorexia associated hyperactivity. Interestingly, in contrast to leptin treatment, food-anticipatory activity still persists in treated ABA rats."

      There is growing interest in the relationship between bone mineral density, bone strength, and fat depots. Marrow adipose tissue, a well-established component of the marrow environment, is metabolically distinct from peripheral fat depots, but its functional significance is unknown.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      In this review, we discuss animal and human data linking the marrow adipose tissue depot to parameters of bone density and integrity as well as the potential significance of marrow adipose tissue in metabolic diseases associated with bone loss, including type 1 diabetes mellitus and anorexia nervosa. Potential hormonal determinants of marrow adipose tissue are also discussed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We conclude that whereas most animal and human data demonstrate an inverse association between marrow adipose tissue and measures of bone density and strength, understanding the functional significance of marrow adipose tissue and its hormonal determinants will be critical to better understanding its role in skeletal integrity and the role of marrow adipose tissue in the pathophysiology of bone loss."

The scope of the research was to drastically alter two important physicochemical properties hydrophobicity (log P) and topological surface area (tPSA) of the compound, which play a critical role in tissue distribution and sequestration (depot effect). Key synthesized analogs demonstrated sub-nanomolar affinity for CB1, marked reduction in hydrophobicity (ClogP∼2.5-3.5 vs 9.09 of Δ8-THC-DMH), and found to function as either agonists (trans-oximes) or neutral antagonists (cis-oximes) in a cAMP functional assay. All oxime analogs showed comparable affinity at the CB2 receptor, but surprisingly they were found to function as inverse agonists for CB2. In behavioral studies (i.e. analgesia, hypothermia) trans-oxime 8a exhibited a predictable fast onset (∼20 min) and short duration of pharmacological action (∼180 min), in contrast to the very prolonged duration of Δ8-THC-DMH (>24 h), thus limiting the potential for severe psychotropic side-effects associated with persistent activation of the CB1 receptor. We have conducted 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of CB1 complexes with AM11542 (CB1 agonist) and both trans-8a and cis-8b isomeric oximes. These studies revealed that the C3 alkyl tail of cis-8b orientated within the CB1 binding pocket in a manner that triggered a conformational change that stabilized the CB1 receptor at its inactive-state (antagonistic functional effect). In contrast, the trans-8a isomer's conformation was coincided with that of the AM11542 CB1 agonist-bound structure, stabilizing the CB1 receptor at the active-state (agonistic functional effect). We have selected oxime trans-8a based on its potency for CB1, and favorable pharmacodynamic profile, such as fast onset and predictable duration of pharmacological action, for evaluation in pre-clinical models of anorexia nervosa."

Like AN, activity-based anorexia (ABA), a rodent model of AN, results in elevation of stress hormones and has genetic links to anxiety disorders. The hippocampus plays a key role in the regulation of anxiety and responds with structural changes to hormones and stress, suggesting that it may play a role in AN. The hippocampus of ABA animals exhibits increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and increased GABA receptor expression, but the structural effects of ABA have not been studied. We used Golgi staining of neurons to determine whether ABA in female rats during adolescence results in structural changes to the apical dendrites in hippocampal CA1 and contrasted to the effects of food restriction (FR) and exercise (EX), the environmental factors used to induce ABA. In the dorsal hippocampus, which preferentially mediates spatial learning and cognition, cells of ABA animals had less total dendritic length and fewer dendritic branches in stratum radiatum (SR) than in control (CON). In the ventral hippocampus, which preferentially mediates anxiety, ABA evoked more branching in SR than CON. In both dorsal and ventral regions, the main effect of exercise was localized to the SR while the main effect of food restriction occurred in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Taken together with data on spine density, these results indicate that ABA elicits pathway-specific changes in the hippocampus that may underlie the increased anxiety and reduced behavioral flexibility observed in ABA."
['Melotto S.'],Clinical pharmacology of eating and not eating.,Curr Opin Pharmacol,"FDA approval of Belviq and Qsymia seems to suggest that novel pharmacological targets to modulate human abnormal eating behaviours are still to be identified. However, a renewed translational approach opens new avenues on eating disorders and female vulnerability, highlighting the role of our reward pathway in obesity and binge eating and leading to potential novel targets. Nevertheless, the 'food addiction' hypothesis is still causing much scientific debate. In this context the interest in the modulation of ghrelin pathway is still very high although, so far, only ghrelin agonism has confirmed its therapeutic potential in cachectic patients. Unfortunately, ghrelin modulation does not offer a therapeutic option for Anorexia Nervosa, where novel promising pharmacological treatments are still to be uncovered."

      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric illness that results in significant bone loss. Studies examining the neuroendocrine dysregulation that occurs in AN may increase understanding of endocrine systems that regulate bone mass. Peptide YY (PYY) is an anorexigenic peptide derived primarily from the intestine, with actions mediated via activation of Y receptors. We have previously shown that PYY levels are elevated in adolescents with AN. Y2 receptor knockout mice have increased bone mineral density (BMD) and thus PYY may play a role in regulating bone mass. We hypothesized that PYY levels would be inversely associated with BMD in women with AN.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a cross-sectional study performed in a General Clinical Research Center of 12 adult women with AN, (mean+/-SEM) mean age 30.9+/-1.8 years, BMI 17.1+/-0.4 kg/m2, and % ideal body weight 77.5+/-1.7%. PYY concentrations were measured hourly from 20:00 h to 08:00 h. BMD was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In women with AN, mean overnight PYY levels strongly inversely correlated with BMD at the PA spine (r=-0.77, p=0.003), lateral spine (r=-0.82, p=0.002), total hip (r=-0.75, p=0.005), femoral neck (r=-0.72, p=0.009), total radius (r=-0.72, p=0.009) and 1/3 distal radius (r=-0.81, p=0.002). Body mass index was inversely correlated with PYY level (r=-0.64, p=0.03). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis was performed to determine the contribution of age, duration of AN, BMI, fat-free mass, and PYY to BMD. For PA and lateral spine, PYY was the primary determinant of BMD, accounting for 59% and 67% of the variability, respectively. Fat-free mass and duration of anorexia nervosa were the primary determinants of BMD at other skeletal sites.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In women with anorexia nervosa, an elevated PYY level is strongly associated with diminished BMD, particularly at the spine. Therefore further investigation of the hypothesis that PYY may contribute to the prevalent bone pathology in this disorder is merited."

Environmental triggers including infection and xenobiotics are hypothesized to lead to the production of brain-directed autoantibodies in a subset of genetically susceptible individuals. Although much work has focused on Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the role of this common childhood infection remains controversial. Animal model studies based on immune and autoantibody findings in TS have demonstrated immunoglobulin (Ig) deposits and stereotypic movements and related behavioral disturbances reminiscent of TS following exposure to GAS, other activators of host anti-microbial responses, soluble immune mediators and anti-GAS or anti-neuronal antibodies. Demonstration of the ability to recreate these abnormalities through passive transfer of serum IgG from GAS-immunized mice into naïve mice and abrogation of this activity through depletion of IgG has provided compelling evidence in support of the autoimmune hypothesis. Immunologically-based animal models of TS are a potent tool for dissecting the pathogenesis of this serious neuropsychiatric syndrome."

Most individuals with AN are females, diagnosed first during adolescence, 40-80% of whom exhibit excessive exercise, and an equally high number with a history of anxiety disorder. We sought to determine the cellular basis for individual differences in AN vulnerability by using an animal model, activity-based anorexia (ABA), that is induced by combining food restriction (FR) with access to a running wheel that allows voluntary exercise. Previously, we showed that by the fourth day of FR, the ABA group of adolescent female rats exhibit >500% greater levels of non-synaptic α4βδ-GABAARs at the plasma membrane of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell spines, relative to the levels found in age-matched controls that are not FR and without wheel access. Here, we show that the ABA group exhibits individual differences in body weight loss, with some losing nearly 30%, while others lose only 15%. The individual differences in weight loss are ascribable to individual differences in wheel activity that both precedes and concurs with days of FR. Moreover, the increase in activity during FR correlates strongly and negatively with α4βδ-GABAAR levels (R=-0.9, p<0.01). This negative correlation is evident within 2days of FR, before body weight loss approaches life-threatening levels for any individual. These findings suggest that increased shunting inhibition by α4βδ-GABAARs in spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons may participate in the protection against the ABA-inducing environmental factors of severe weight loss by suppressing excitability of the CA1 pyramidal neurons which, in turn, is related indirectly to suppression of excessive exercise. The data also indicate that, although exercise has many health benefits, it can be maladaptive to individuals with low levels of α4βδ-GABAARs in the CA1, particularly when combined with FR."

The potential neuronal deficits that may underlie abnormal inhibitions of food intake, however, remain largely unexplored. We hypothesized that anorexia may involve altered signaling events within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain structure involved in reward. We show here that direct stimulation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 4 receptors (5-HT(4)R) in the NAc reduces the physiological drive to eat and increases CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) mRNA levels in fed and food-deprived mice. It further shows that injecting 5-HT(4)R antagonist or siRNA-mediated 5-HT(4)R knockdown into the NAc induced hyperphagia only in fed mice. This hyperphagia was not associated with changes in CART mRNA expression in the NAc in fed and food-deprived mice. Results include that 5-HT(4)R control CART mRNA expression into the NAc via a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Considering that CART may interfere with food- and drug-related rewards, we tested whether the appetite suppressant properties of 3,4-N-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) involve the 5-HT(4)R. Using 5-HT(4)R knockout mice, we demonstrate that 5-HT(4)R are required for the anorectic effect of MDMA as well as for the MDMA-induced enhancement of CART mRNA expression in the NAc. Directly injecting CART peptide or CART siRNA into the NAc reduces or increases food consumption, respectively. Finally, stimulating 5-HT(4)R- and MDMA-induced anorexia were both reduced by injecting CART siRNA into the NAc. Collectively, these results demonstrate that 5-HT(4)R-mediated up-regulation of CART in the NAc triggers the appetite-suppressant effects of ecstasy."

          Results:
        
      
      In ABA rats, the volumes of the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum were significantly reduced compared to controls by 6% and 9%, respectively. The number of GFAP-positive astrocytes in these regions decreased by 39% and 23%, total astrocyte-covered area by 83% and 63%. In neurons no changes were observed.

      Volumetric brain changes in ABA animals mirror those in human AN patients. These alterations are associated with a reduction of GFAP-positive astrocytes as well as GFAP expression. Reduced astrocyte functioning could help explain neuronal dysfunctions leading to symptoms of rigidity and impaired learning.

The stimulation of the ghrelin system represents a potential therapeutic approach in various disorders characterized by deficient ghrelin signaling or by low appetite. This stimulation may be achieved via pharmacological targeting of the ghrelin receptor with synthetic ghrelin or ghrelin mimetics or via increased endogenous ghrelin production. Recently, it was demonstrated that gastric electrical stimulation (GES) with Enterra parameters results in increased ghrelin production in rats. Furthermore, recent data revealed putative role of ghrelin-reactive immunoglobulins in the modulation of the ghrelin signaling which can be also stimulated by GES. Here, we review the links between GES and ghrelin in existing GES experimental and clinical applications for treatment of gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia or obesity and discuss if GES can be proposed as a non-pharmacological approach to improve ghrelin secretion in several pathological conditions characterized by low appetite, such as anorexia nervosa or anorexia-cachexia syndrome."
"['Ghigo E', 'Arvat E', 'Muccioli G', 'Camanni F.']",Growth hormone-releasing peptides.,Eur J Endocrinol,"Growth hormone-releasing peptides (GHRPs) are synthetic, non-natural peptides endowed with potent stimulatory effects on somatotrope secretion in animals and humans. They have no structural homology with GHRH and act via specific receptors present either at the pituitary or the hypothalamic level both in animals and in humans. The GHRP receptor has recently been cloned and, interestingly, it does not show sequence homology with other G-protein-coupled receptors known so far. This evidence strongly suggests the existence of a natural GHRP-like ligand which, however, has not yet been found. The mechanisms underlying the GHRP effect are still unclear. At present, several data favor the hypothesis that GHRPs could act by counteracting somatostatinergic activity both at the pituitary and the hypothalamic level and/or, at least partially, via a GHRH-mediated mechanism. However, the possibility that GHRPs act via an unknown hypothalamic factor (U factor) is still open. GHRP-6 was the first hexapeptide to be extensively studied in humans. More recently, a heptapeptide, GHRP-1, and two other hexapeptides, GHRP-2 and Hexarelin, have been synthesized and are now available for human studies. Moreover, non-peptidyl GHRP mimetics have been developed which act via GHRP receptors and their effects have been clearly demonstrated in animals and in humans in vivo. Among non-peptidyl GHRPs, MK-0677 seems the most interesting molecule. The GH-releasing activity of GHRPs is marked and dose-related after intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal and even oral administration. The effect of GHRPs is reproducible and undergoes partial desensitization, more during continuous infusion, less during intermittent administration: in fact, prolonged administration of GHRPs increases IGF-1 levels both in animals and in humans. The GH-releasing effect of GHRPs does not depend on sex but undergoes age-related variations. It increases from birth to puberty, persists at a similar level in adulthood and decreases thereafter. By the sixth decade of life, the activity of GHRPs is reduced but it is still marked and higher than that of GHRH. The GH-releasing activity of GHRPs is synergistic with that of GHRH, is not affected by opioid receptor antagonists, such as naloxone, and is only blunted by inhibitory influences, including neurotransmitters, glucose, free fatty acids, gluco corticoids, recombinant human GH and even exogenous somatostatin, which are known to almost abolish the effect of GHRH. GHRPs maintain their GH-releasing effect in somatotrope hypersecretory states such as in acromegaly, anorexia nervosa and hyperthyroidism. On the other hand, their good GH-releasing activity has been shown in some but not in other somatotrope hyposecretory states. In fact, reduced GH responses after GHRP administration have been reported in idiopathic GH deficiency as well as in idiopathic short stature, in obesity and in hypothyroidism, while in patients with pituitary stalk disconnection or Cushing's syndrome the somatotrope responsiveness to GHRPs is almost absent. In short children an increase in height velocity has also been reported during chronic GHRP treatment. Thus, based on their marked GH-releasing effect even after oral administration, GHRPs offer their own clinical usefulness for treatment of some GH hyposecretory states."

Adolescent female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 4 groups: control (24h/day food access), food-restricted (1h/day food access), exercise (24h/day food and wheel access), and ABA (1h/day food access, 24h/day wheel access). After 3 days of ABA, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 200mg/kg, i.p.) was injected and the rats were perfused 2h later. Brains were removed and subsequently processed for BrdU and Ki67 immunohistochemistry. The acute induction of ABA reduced cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus. This effect was significant in the hilus region of the dentate gyrus, but not in the subgranular zone, where adult neurogenesis occurs. Marked decreases in cell proliferation were also observed in the surrounding dorsal hippocampus and in the corpus callosum. These results indicate a primary effect on gliogenesis rather than neurogenesis following 3 days of ABA. For each brain region studied (except SGZ), there was a strong positive correlation between the level of cell proliferation and body weight/food intake. Future studies should examine whether these changes are maintained following long-term weight restoration and whether alterations in neurogenesis occur following longer exposures to ABA."

['Bonjour JP.'],"The dietary protein, IGF-I, skeletal health axis.",Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig,"Dietary protein represents an important nutrient for bone health and thereby for the prevention of osteoporosis. Besides its role as a brick provider for building the organic matrix of skeletal tissues, dietary protein stimulates the production of the anabolic bone trophic factor IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor I). The liver is the main source of circulating IGF-I. During growth, protein undernutrition results in reduced bone mass and strength. Genetic defect impairing the production of IGF-I markedly reduces bone development in both length and width. The serum level of IGF-I markedly increases and then decreases during pubertal maturation in parallel with the change in bone growth and standing height velocity. The impact of physical activity on bone structure and strength is enhanced by increased dietary protein consumption. This synergism between these two important environmental factors can be observed in prepubertal boys, thus modifying the genetically determined bone growth trajectory. In anorexia nervosa, IGF-I is low as well as bone mineral mass. In selective protein undernutrition, there is a resistance to the exogenous bone anabolic effect of IGF-I. A series of animal experiments and human clinical trials underscore the positive effect of increased dietary intake of protein on calcium-phosphate economy and bone balance. On the contrary, the dietary protein-induced acidosis hypothesis of osteoporosis is not supported by several experimental and clinical studies. There is a direct effect of amino acids on the local production of IGF-I by osteoblastic cells. IGF-I is likely the main mediator of the positive effect of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on bone formation, thus explaining the reduction in fragility fractures as observed in PTH-treated postmenopausal women. In elderly women and men, relatively high protein intake protects against spinal and femoral bone loss. In hip fracture patients, isocaloric correction of the relatively low protein intake results in: increased IGF-I serum level, significant attenuation of postsurgical bone loss, improved muscle strength, better recovery, and shortened hospital stay. Thus, dietary protein contributes to bone health from early childhood to old age. An adequate intake of protein should be recommended in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis."

There are three different ED diseases: Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and Binge Eating Disorders (BED). ED are complex conditions that arise from a combination of long-standing behavioral, emotional, psychological, interpersonal, and social factors. The neuronal circuits that control the ingestion of food are mainly related to catecholaminergic, serotoninergic and peptidergic systems. In this respect, while serotonin, dopamine and prostaglandin promote the ingestion of food, by contrast, neuropeptide Y, norepinephrine, GABA and opioid peptides inhibit food ingestion, thus, causing the occurence of ED. The drugs mainly used in the treatment of ED are antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. Additionally, mood stabilizers (lithium), anxiolytics, serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors and antipsychotic drugs are often used in the treatment of ED."

To this effect, we propose that a continuum of liability obtains between stress, anxiety states and anorexia nervosa--a continuum which is grounded on a cytokine profile common to each of these conditions. For example, the biological response to stress, anxiety states and anorexia nervosa includes the elevation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and downregulation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Sustained elevation of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha dysregulates both somatostatin and insulin secretion, the latter of which influences regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and brain energy metabolism. In addition, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha influence the expression of certain crucial neuropeptides, which are known to be associated with anxiety states and anorexia nervosa. These neuropeptides include: beta-endorphin, cholecystokinin (CCK), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). beta-endorphin effects glucose metabolism in the limbic system, CCK increases the release of beta-endorphin from the anterior pituitary, NPY is a powerful anxiolytic that regulates beta-endorphin and insulin, while VIP indirectly regulates the expression of TNF-alpha through the inhibition of interleukin-4 (IL-4)."

We used the open field test before food restriction and the elevated plus maze test (EPM) during food restriction to quantify anxiety among singly housed adolescent female mice and determined whether food restriction alone or combined with exercise (i.e., ABA induction) abates or increases anxiety. We show that food restriction, with or without exercise, reduced anxiety significantly, as measured by the proportion of entries into the open arms of EPM (35.73%, p = .04). Moreover, ABA-induced individuals varied in their open arm time measure of anxiety and this value was highly and negatively correlated to the individual's food restriction-evoked wheel activity during the 24 hr following the anxiety test (R = -.75, p = .004, N = 12). This correlation was absent among the exercise-only controls. In addition, mice with higher increase in anxiety ran more following food restriction. Our data suggest that food restriction-evoked wheel running hyperactivity can be used as a reliable and continuous measure of anxiety in ABA. The parallel relationship between anxiety level and activity in AN and ABA-induced female mice strengthens the animal model."

Pyloric smooth muscle bears specific CCK receptors and the evidence suggests that a major site of action for CCK satiety is in the periphery. CCK receptors are widespread in the neonatal rat stomach but not in the brain and over the first two weeks of life binding in the stomach decreases and that in the brain increases. This and the finding that independent ingestion as well as gastric emptying are inhibited by CCK at birth suggest the stomach as its likely site of action in the neonatal rat. Fenfluramine inhibits feeding in animals and in patients with bulimia nervosa. In monkeys, fenfluramine inhibits gastric emptying and this action correlates with its feeding inhibition. Patients with anorexia nervosa who are acutely starving and rats maintained on a restricted diet have delayed gastric emptying. Anorexic patients showed abnormal reporting of both hunger and satiety, and, together with those with bulimia nervosa, often associated gastric contents with symptoms of eating disorder, indicating disturbed interpretation of gastric signals."

      Several lines of evidence strongly implicate a dysfunctional endocannabinoid system (ECS) in eating disorders. Using [(18)F]MK-9470 and small animal positron emission tomography (PET), we investigated for the first time cerebral changes in type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor binding in vivo in the activity-based rat model of anorexia (ABA), in comparison to distinct motor- and food-related control conditions and in relation to gender and behavioural variables.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In total, experiments were conducted on 80 Wistar rats (23 male and 57 female). Male rats were assigned to the cross-sectional conditions: ABA (n = 12) and CONTROL (n = 11), whereas female rats were divided between two settings: (1) a cross-sectional design using ABA (n = 13), CONTROL (n = 9), and two extra control conditions for each of the variables manipulated in ABA, i.e. DIET (n = 8) and WHEEL (n = 9), and (2) a longitudinal one using ABA (n = 10) and CONTROL (n = 8) studied at baseline, during the model and upon recovery. The ABA group was subjected to food restriction in the presence of a running wheel, the DIET group to food restriction without wheel, the WHEEL group to a normal diet with wheel and CONTROL animals had a normal diet and no running wheel. Parametric CB1 receptor images of each group were spatially normalized to Paxinos space and analysed voxel-wise.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the ABA model, absolute [(18)F]MK-9470 binding was significantly increased in all cortical and subcortical brain areas as compared to control conditions (male +67 %; female >51%, all p cluster < 6.3×10(-6)) that normalized towards baseline values after weight gain. Additionally, relative [(18)F]MK-9470 binding was increased in the hippocampus, inferior colliculus and entorhinal cortex of female ABA (+4.6%; p cluster < 1.3×10(-6)), whereas no regional differences were observed in male subjects. Again, relative [(18)F]MK-9470 binding values normalized upon weight gain.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These data point to a widespread transient disturbance of the endocannabinoid transmission, specifically for CB1 receptors in the ABA model. Our data also suggest (1) gender effects on regional CB1 receptor binding in the hippocampus and (2) add further proof to the validity of the ABA model to mimic aspects of human disease."
"['Lim CT', 'Kola B', 'Korbonits M.']",The ghrelin/GOAT/GHS-R system and energy metabolism.,Rev Endocr Metab Disord,"Ghrelin is a brain-gut peptide that was discovered through reverse pharmacology and was first isolated from extracts of porcine stomach. Ghrelin binds to growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) and is acylated on its serine 3 residue by ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT). Several important biological functions of ghrelin have been identified, which include its growth hormone-releasing and appetite-inducing effects. Ghrelin exerts its central orexigenic effect mainly by acting on the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus via the activation of the GHS-R. Peripherally ghrelin has multiple metabolic effects which include promoting gluconeogenesis and fat deposition. These effects together with the increased food intake lead to an overall body weight gain. AMP-activated protein kinase, which is a key enzyme in energy homeostasis, has been shown to mediate the central and peripheral metabolic effects of ghrelin. The hypothalamic fatty acid pathway, hypothalamic mitochondrial respiration and uncoupling protein 2 have all been shown to act as the downstream targets of AMPK in mediating the orexigenic effects of ghrelin. Abnormal levels of ghrelin are associated with several metabolic conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, Prader-Willi syndrome and anorexia nervosa. The ghrelin/GOAT/GHS-R system is now recognised as a potential target for the development of anti-obesity treatment."

Girls with AN reported exceptional compliance with vitamin D supplementation and PTH concentrations were lower. Vitamin D deficiency was less common in the group with AN, but when race was considered, the trend was no longer significant.
    


          Introduction:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to determine whether patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) are more compliant with supplementation and have a lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency than healthy controls.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fifty adolescents with AN and 200 controls were compared using anthropometric and lifestyle data, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations, and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The prevalence of deficiency (<20 ng/mL) was 2% in the AN group vs. 24% among controls (p = 0.003). 25OHD was similar among white participants with AN and white controls (39.5 vs. 36.0 ng/mL, p = 0.20), but higher than in non-white controls (20.6 ng/mL). Significantly more girls with AN reported vitamin D supplementation (86%) than the full control (14%) or white subgroup (27%) (p < 0.001). Participants with AN had lower PTH concentrations than controls, (27.8 vs. 47.4 pg/mL, p = 0.009), a trend that lost significance after age and race adjustment (41.7 pg/mL, p = 0.12).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Compared to healthy controls, adolescents with AN had a lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and PTH concentration. However, 25OHD and PTH concentrations were similar after adjustment for race and age. The trend of lower PTH levels in adolescents with AN, accompanied by exceptional compliance with supplementation, may have bone health implications for these patients."
"['Compan V', 'Walsh BT', 'Kaye W', 'Geliebter A.']",How Does the Brain Implement Adaptive Decision Making to Eat?,J Neurosci,"Adaptive decision making to eat is crucial for survival, but in anorexia nervosa, the brain persistently supports reduced food intake despite a growing need for energy. How the brain persists in reducing food intake, sometimes even to the point of death and despite the evolution of multiple mechanisms to ensure survival by governing adaptive eating behaviors, remains mysterious. Neural substrates belong to the reward-habit system, which could differ among the eating disorders. The present review provides an overview of neural circuitry of restrictive food choice, binge eating, and the contribution of specific serotonin receptors. One possibility is that restrictive food intake critically engages goal-directed (decision making) systems and ""habit,"" supporting the view that persistent caloric restriction mimics some aspects of addiction to drugs of abuse.
    


          Significance statement:
        
      
      An improved understanding of the neural basis of eating disorders is a timely challenge because these disorders can be deadly. Up to 70 million of people in the world suffer from eating disorders. Anorexia nervosa affects 1-4% of women in United States and is the first cause of death among adolescents in Europe. Studies relying on animal models suggest that decision making to eat (or not) can prevail over actual energy requirements due to emotional disturbances resulting in abnormal habitual behavior, mimicking dependence. These recent studies provide a foundation for developing more specific and effective interventions for these disorders."

However, it is not known whether such increase can be related to the number of preproghrelin mRNA-expressing cells in the stomach, and if chronic starvation may activate a tentative central ghrelin production. In this work, in situ hybridization technique was used to analyze the presence and number of preproghrelin mRNA-expressing cells in the stomach and the hypothalamus of mice with activity-based anorexia (ABA) induced by the combination of running wheel activity with progressive, during 10 days, feeding-time restriction (FTR) and compared with sedentary FTR, ABA pair-fed (PF) and ad libitum-fed control mice. All food-restricted mice lost more than 20% of body weight. Body weight loss was similar in ABA and PF mice, but it was more pronounced than in FTR mice. Food intake was also lower in ABA than in FTR mice. Preproghrelin mRNA-expressing cells in the stomach were increased proportionally to the body weight loss in all food-restricted groups with the highest number in ABA mice. No preproghrelin mRNA-producing cells were detectable in the hypothalamus of either control or food-restricted mice. Thus, the increased number of gastric preproghrelin mRNA-producing cells during chronic starvation proportionally to the body weight loss and reduced food intake may underlie increased plasma ghrelin. Hyperactivity-induced anorexia appears to further increase the number of preproghrelin mRNA-producing cells in the stomach. No evidence was found for ghrelin expression in the hypothalamus, not even in any of the present experimental models."
"['Marchi F', 'Vergani F', 'Chiavacci I', 'Gullan R', 'Ashkan K.']",Geoffrey Knight and his contribution to psychosurgery.,J Neurosurg,"This paper retraces the fundamental achievements of Geoffrey Knight (1906-1994), a British neurosurgeon and a pioneer in the field of psychosurgery. His career developed in the 1950s and 1960s, when-following the unregulated practice of frontal lobotomies-strong criticism arose in the medical community and in the general public against psychosurgery. Geoffrey Knight's clinical research focused on identifying new, selective targets to limit the side effects of psychosurgery while improving the outcome of patients affected by mental disorders. Following the example of William Beecher Scoville, he initially developed restricted orbital undercutting as a less invasive alternative to standard frontal lobotomy. He then developed stereotactic subcaudate tractotomy, with the use of an original stereotactic device. Knight stressed the importance of the anatomy and neurophysiology of the structures targeted in subcaudate tractotomy, with particular regard to the fibers connecting the anterior cingulate region, the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the hypothalamus. Of interest, the role of these white matter connections has been recently recognized in deep brain stimulation for major depression and anorexia nervosa. This is perhaps the most enduring legacy of Knight to the field of psychosurgery. He refined frontal leucotomies by selecting a restricted target at the center of a network that plays a crucial role in controlling mood disorders. He then developed a safe, minimally invasive stereotactic operation to reach this target. His work, well ahead of his time, still represents a valid reference on which to build future clinical experience in the modern era of neuromodulation for psychiatric diseases."
"['Monteleone P', 'DiLieto A', 'Castaldo E', 'Maj M.']",Leptin functioning in eating disorders.,CNS Spectr,"Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone, which is involved predominantly in the long-term regulation of body weight and energy balance by acting as a hunger suppressant signal to the brain. Leptin is also involved in the modulation of reproduction, immune function, physical activity, and some endogenous endocrine axes. Since anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are characterized by abnormal eating behaviors, dysregulation of endogenous endocrine axes, alterations of reproductive and immune functions, and increased physical activity, extensive research has been carried out in the last decade in order to ascertain a role of this hormone in the pathophysiology of these syndromes. In this article, we review the available data on leptin physiology in patients with eating disorders. These data support the idea that leptin is not directly involved in the etiology of AN or BN. However, malnutrition-induced alterations in its physiology may contribute to the genesis and/or the maintenance of some clinical manifestations of AN and BN and may have an impact on the prognosis of AN."
"['Capasso A', 'Milano W', 'Cauli O.']",Changes in the Peripheral Endocannabinoid System as a Risk Factor for the Development of Eating Disorders.,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets,"Background and objective:
        
      
      Eating Disorder (ED) is characterized by persistently and severely disturbed eating behaviours. They arise from a combination of long-standing behavioural, emotional, psychological, interpersonal, and social factors and result in insufficient nutrient ingestion and/or adsorption. The three main EDs are: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. We review the role of peripheral endocannabinoids in eating behaviour.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The neuronal pathways involved in feeding behaviours are closely related to catecholaminergic, serotoninergic and peptidergic systems. Accordingly, feeding is promoted by serotonin, dopamine, and prostaglandin and inhibited by neuropeptide Y, norepinephrine, GABA, and opioid peptides. The endocannabinoid system plays a role in EDs, and multiple lines of evidence indicate that the cannabinoid signalling system is a key modulatory factor of the activity in the brain areas involved in EDs as well as in reward processes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Besides their central role in controlling food behaviours, peripheral cannabinoids are also involved in regulating adipose tissue and insulin signalling as well as cell metabolism in peripheral tissues such as liver, pancreas, fatty tissue, and skeletal muscle. Altogether, these data indicate that peripheral cannabinoids can provide new therapeutic targets not only for EDs but also for metabolic disease."

To explore the underlying mechanisms of these disorders, the colonic proteome was evaluated during activity-based anorexia. Female C57Bl/6 mice were randomized into three groups: Control, Limited Food Access (LFA) and Activity-Based Anorexia (ABA). LFA and ABA mice had a progressive limited access to food but only ABA mice had access to an activity wheel. On colonic mucosal protein extracts, a 2D PAGE-based comparative proteomic analysis was then performed and differentially expressed proteins were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Twenty-seven nonredundant proteins that were differentially expressed between Control, LFA, and ABA groups were identified. ABA mice exhibited alteration of several mitochondrial proteins involved in energy metabolism such as dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. In addition, a downregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was observed leading, on the one hand, to the inhibition of protein synthesis, evaluated by puromycin incorporation and mediated by the increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2, and on the other hand, to the activation of autophagy, assessed by the increase of the marker of autophagy, form LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate/Cytosolic form of Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3II/LC3I) ratio. Colonic mucosal proteome is altered during ABA suggesting a downregulation of energy metabolism. A decrease of protein synthesis and an activation of autophagy were also observed mediated by mTOR pathway."

Here we propose an integrative genetic approach to reveal novel biological substrates of eating disorder traits analogous in mouse and human. For example, comparable to behavioral hyperactivity that is observed in 40-80% of anorexia nervosa patients, inbred strains of mice with different genetic backgrounds are differentially susceptible to develop behavioral hyperactivity when food restricted. In addition, a list of characteristics that are relevant to eating disorders and approaches to their measurement in humans together with potential analogous rodent models has been generated. Interspecies genetics of neurobehavioral characteristics of eating disorders has the potential to open new roads to identify and functionally test genetic pathways that influence neurocircuits relevant for these heterogeneous psychiatric disorders."

Once ABA rats had lost 20% of body weight, half of the animals were exposed to a high ambient temperature (HAT) of 32 degrees C, whereas the rest were maintained at 21 degrees C. Control sedentary rats yoked to ABA animals received the same treatment. ABA rats (21 degrees C) showed increased Melanocortin 4 (MC4) receptor and Agouti gene Related Peptide (AgRP) expression, and decreased pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA levels (Real Time PCR), with respect to controls. Heat application increased weight gain and food intake, and reduced running rate in ABA rats, when compared with ABA rats at 21 degrees C. However, no changes in body weight and food intake were observed in sedentary rats exposed to heat. Moreover, heat application reduced MC4 receptor, AgRP and POMC expression in ABA rats, but no changes were observed in control rats. These results indicate that hypothalamic MC4 receptor overexpression could occur on the basis of the characteristic hyperactivity, weight loss, and self-starvation of ABA rats, and suggest the involvement of hypothalamic melanocortin neural circuits in behavioural changes shown by AN patients. Changes in AgRP and POMC expression could represent an adaptative response to equilibrate energy balance. Moreover, the fact that HAT reversed hypothalamic MC4 receptor overexpression in ABA rats indicates the involvement of brain melanocortin system in the reported beneficial effects of heat application in AN. A combination of MC4 receptor antagonists and heat application could improve the clinical management of AN."

Therefore, technical developments in the detection of adipocytes become an important driving factor in adipogenesis research. Current techniques such as optical microscopy and flow cytometry are available in detection and examination of adipocytes, driving cell- and molecular-based research of adipogenesis. Even though microscopy techniques are common and straightforward, they are restricted in terms of manipulation and separation of the cells. Flow cytometry is an alternative, but mature adipocytes are fragile and cannot withstand the flow process. Other separation methods usually require labeling of the cells or usage of microfluidic platforms that utilize fluids with different densities. Magnetic levitation is a novel label-free technology with the principle of movement of cells towards the lower magnetic field in a paramagnetic medium depending on their individual densities. In this study, we used a magnetic levitation device for density-based single cell detection of differentiated adipogenic cells in heterogeneous populations. Results showed that the magnetic levitation platform was sensitive to changes in the lipid content of mesenchymal stem cells committed to adipogenesis and it could be successfully used to detect the adipogenic differentiation of the cells."

Interspecies trait genetics may offer opportunities to identify common neurobiological mechanisms underlying eating disorder characteristics relevant to the initiation, progression, and/or maintenance of the disease, such as cognitive rigidity, increased anxiety levels, and behavioral hyperactivity. These can subsequently be tested directly by studying allelic variation in mice and human subjects and by applying methods that can modify gene expression levels in rodent models. Increasing our knowledge about these traits and their underlying neurobiological mechanisms will be relevant to develop new therapies for patients within the heterogeneous eating disorder populations. Novel mouse genetic and phenotyping tools offer a way to study these neurobehavioral traits under controlled environmental and genetic background conditions."

Access to food was constrained to four 40 min food opportunities (FOs) per day, spaced 4-h apart through the dark phase. Nose poke responses and pellet deliveries were collected at 10-s resolution to allow pellet-by-pellet analysis. In the FI protocol, mice maintained adequate food intake and body weight through the study, even though at the highest FI (50-s) they spent the entire 40-min FOs engaged in eating at or near the maximum rate allowed by the schedule. In the FUP protocol, mice greatly reduced their intake and lost weight at the highest FUP (50 responses/pellet). The analysis of response and pellet distributions showed these mice were not filling the FOs with responding and ate less at dusk (FO #1) and dawn (FO #4) than at FOs #2 and 3 in the middle of the night. The principal, and unexpected, sex difference was that females tended to eat more than males despite lower body weight, but behavioral changes as a function of feeding cost or schedule were qualitatively similar in both sexes. These results show that slow eating as imposed by an FI is not sufficient to produce hypophagia and, in the FUP protocol, hypophagia cannot be explained by slowed eating due to response requirements. We discuss the role of effort or time in FUP-induced anorexia, and suggest this murine model may emulate some aspects of human anorexia nervosa better than current activity-based protocols."

Thus, altered serotonergic function may be involved in the etiology of anorexia nervosa. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined whether activation of the serotonin system increases the severity of activity-based anorexia, an animal model of anorexia nervosa in which food-restricted rats are housed with access to running wheels. This paradigm promotes symptoms of anorexia nervosa, including hypophagia, hyperactivity, and weight loss. Food-restricted rats received injections of a serotonin agonist, fenfluramine, or saline 1.5 h prior to their daily 2-h period of food access. A third saline-injected group was pair-fed to the fenfluramine group. Drug treatment and food restriction were terminated following a 25% weight loss. During food restriction, each group developed symptoms of activity-based anorexia. Although similar reductions in food intake were observed in fenfluramine-treated and pair-fed rats, only fenfluramine-treated rats displayed an accelerated rate of weight loss, relative to saline-treated rats. Thus, some other nonanorexic aspect of fenfluramine, perhaps its influence on metabolism, must underlie the accelerated rate of weight loss in this group. Our results suggest that increased activation of the serotonin system exacerbates the weight loss associated with activity-based anorexia."

Regional metabolic changes were investigated using statistical parametric mapping (SPM2) and correlated to weight and hyperactivity measures on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Higher regional metabolism was found in ABA rats in the mediodorsal thalamus, ventral pontine nuclei and cerebellum, while hypometabolism was seen in the left rhinal and bilateral insular cortex, and bilateral ventral striatum (p<0.001). A positive correlation was observed between body weight loss and brain metabolism in the cingulate cortex and surrounding motor and somatosensory cortex (p<0.001). Thus, in the ABA model metabolic changes are present in brain areas related to disease status and weight loss, which share several characteristics with the human disease."

Two systems are of particular interest in this respect, synthesizing alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and synthesizing neuropeptide Y, respectively. We report here that 42 of 57 (74%) AN andor BN patients studied had in their plasma Abs that bind to melanotropes andor corticotropes in the rat pituitary. Among these sera, 8 were found to bind selectively to alpha-MSH-positive neurons and their hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic projections as revealed with immunostaining on rat brain sections. Adsorption of these sera with alpha-MSH peptide abolished this immunostaining. In the pituitary, the immunostaining was blocked by adsorption with alpha-MSH or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Additionally, 3 ANBN sera bound to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)-positive terminals in the rat median eminence, but only 2 of them were adsorbed with LHRH. In the control subjects, 2 of 13 sera (16%) displayed similar to ANBN staining. These data provide evidence that a significant subpopulation of ANBN patients have autoantibodies that bind to alpha-MSH or adrenocorticotropic hormone, a finding pointing also to involvement of the stress axis. It remains to be established whether these Abs interfere with normal signal transduction in the brain melanocortin circuitryLHRH system andor in other central and peripheral sites relevant to food intake regulation, to what extent such effects are related to andor could be involved in the pathophysiology or clinical presentation of ANBN, and to what extent increased stress is an important factor for production of these autoantibodies."

A review of basic research, implicating estradiol in the physiologic control of eating in laboratory animals, shows potential heuristic and mechanistic significance for normal and disordered eating in women. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that estradiol may decrease meal size by increasing the potency of the satiating actions of some gut peptides, especially cholecystokinin.

Some of these alterations are believed not only to sustain the altered eating behavior but also to contribute to certain psychopathological aspects and/or etiopathogenetic processes of eating disorders (EDs). It has been suggested that EDs are clinical conditions linked to reward-related mechanisms leading to a kind of addiction to self-starvation and/or overeating. Most of the feeding regulatory substances, which are dysregulated in EDs, are also implicated in the modulation of reward, emotional, and cognitive functions, thus representing possible links between altered nutritional regulation, motivated behaviors and reward processes. In this chapter, the ED literature dealing with ghrelin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, opioid peptides, and endocannabinoids, which have prominent effects on eating behavior, body weight, reward, emotional, and cognitive functions, is reviewed in view of the above suggested links. Moreover, the potential therapeutics of new medications developed on the basis of neuroendocrine aberrations found in EDs is also presented."

To address this question, we analyzed plasma levels, affinity kinetics, and binding epitopes of α-MSH-reactive IgG extracted from plasma samples of female patients with hyperphagic obesity, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and healthy controls. Ability of α-MSH/IgG IC to bind and activate human MC4R were studied in vitro and to influence feeding behavior in vivo in rodents. We found that α-MSH-reactive IgG were low in obese but increased in anorectic and bulimic patients and displayed different epitope and kinetics of IC formation. Importantly, while α-MSH/IgG IC from all subjects were binding and activating MC4R, the receptor binding affinity was decreased in obesity. Additionally, α-MSH/IgG IC had lower MC4R-mediated cAMP activation threshold as compared with α-MSH alone in all but not obese subjects. Furthermore, the cellular internalization rate of α-MSH/IgG IC by MC4R-expressing cells was decreased in obese but increased in patients with anorexia nervosa. Moreover, IgG from obese patients prevented central anorexigenic effect of α-MSH. These findings reveal that MC4R is physiologically activated by IC formed by α-MSH/IgG and that different levels and molecular properties of α-MSH-reactive IgG underlie biological activity of such IC relevant to altered appetite in obesity and eating disorders."

This suggests that they have important functions during neurodevelopment. This suggestion is supported by data showing that neurite outgrowth, cell survival and neural circuit formation can be affected by disruption of these genes. Here, we review the current genetic data about their involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders and explore studies on how null mutations affect mouse behavior. Finally, we highlight to role of protein-protein interactions in the potential mechanism of action of Cntn4, -5 and -6 and emphasize that complexes with other membrane proteins may play a role in neuronal developmental functions."
"['Liang NC', 'Bello NT', 'Moran TH.']",Experience with activity based anorexia enhances conditioned taste aversion learning in rats.,Physiol Behav,"Activity based anorexia (ABA) is a model that mimics the self-starvation and hyperactivity features of anorexia nervosa (AN). This study investigated whether a history of ABA will enhance food avoidance learning and retard its extinction in female rats. We compared the acquisition and extinction of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in naive (ad lib with no access to RW), ABA, and pair-fed to the food intake of ABA (with access to a locked RW) female Sprague-Dawley rats. The CTA conditioning was conducted after the ABA and pair-fed rats had recovered to their pre-food restriction body weights. For the CTA learning, 0.3M sucrose consumption was followed by low doses LiCl (0.009M or 0.018M at 1.33ml/100g of body weight, IP) injection. The results revealed that the ABA rats acquired an aversion to sucrose significantly sooner than the naive controls. Furthermore, they completely avoided sucrose while the naive and pair-fed controls still sampled it by the end of 10 conditioning trials. When extinction was assessed by 1-bottle and 2-bottle tests, the ABA rats extinguished more slowly than the controls. However, the differences in sucrose aversion extinction between the ABA and control rats were only significant in the 1-bottle test. These data suggest that experience with AN-like behaviors results in an acquired aversion to a preferred food sooner and a longer retention of the negative food associations. These findings have implications for understanding the persistence of aberrant eating behaviors in eating disorders."

"['Dixon DP', 'Ackert AM', 'Eckel LA.']","Development of, and recovery from, activity-based anorexia in female rats.",Physiol Behav,"Activity-based anorexia occurs in rats maintained on a restricted-feeding schedule while given free access to running wheels. These conditions induce high levels of wheel running and rapid weight loss. Although this procedure was developed as an animal model of anorexia nervosa, it has been studied primarily in male rats. Our goal was to examine the development of, and recovery from, activity-based anorexia in female rats. Food intake, wheel running, body weight, and phase of the estrous cycle were monitored daily prior to, during, and after a period of restricted feeding in which access to food was limited to 2 h/day. Food intake, body weight, and estrous cyclicity were also monitored in a control group housed without access to running wheels. Prior to food restriction, rats with wheels displayed high levels of wheel running and consumed more food than rats without wheels. Despite that both groups consumed similar amounts of food during the restricted-feeding phase, only rats with wheels developed symptoms of activity-based anorexia, including increased wheel running, rapid weight loss, and disruptions in estrous cyclicity. Recovery from activity-based anorexia was associated with hypoactivity and hyperphagia. Resumption of estrous cycles occurred when the weight lost during food restriction was regained. Hyperphagia, but not hypoactivity, was maintained following resumption of estrous cycles; however, this hyperphagia was limited to nonestrous phases. Our findings suggest that recovery from activity-based anorexia is mediated primarily by an increase in orexigenic signaling that promotes pronounced hyperphagia, and that the increase in satiogenic signaling during estrus abolishes this compensatory hyperphagia."
"['Blüher S', 'Mantzoros CS.']",Leptin in reproduction.,Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Leptin, a key hormone in energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine function, has a permissive role in initiating puberty and is crucial in the pathogenesis of reproductive dysfunction in several disease states of energy imbalance. KiSS1 neurons have recently been suggested to mediate leptin's effect on the reproductive system. New insights from recent animal studies and clinical trials are discussed.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Alterations in the expression profile of the KiSS1 gene and the kisspeptin receptor have been linked to reproductive dysfunction in leptin-deficient states. Neuroendocrine, including reproductive, dysfunction can be restored in humans and animals by leptin-replacement therapy. These insights have significantly advanced our understanding of hormonal systems needed to maintain normal reproduction. These data, if confirmed, also suggest a role for leptin as a novel therapeutic approach in several disease states.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Recent proof-of-concept studies involving leptin administration to humans underline the critical role of leptin not only in regulating energy homeostasis, but also in maintaining normal reproductive function. Leptin-replacement therapy is currently under intensive investigation as a potential novel therapeutic option for several conditions associated with reproductive dysfunction due to hypoleptinemia."

      Activity-based anorexia is an animal model of anorexia nervosa in which limited access to standard lab chow combined with voluntary wheel running leads to hypophagia and severe weight loss. This study tested whether activity-based anorexia could be prevented or reversed with palatable foods.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Male rats were divided into sedentary or ad libitum-running groups and maintained on 1 h daily access to standard chow plus one of the following: sugar, saccharin, vegetable fat (shortening), or sweet high-fat chow.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Access to the sweet high-fat chow both reversed and prevented the weight loss typical of activity-based anorexia. Vegetable fat attenuated body weight loss, but to a lesser degree than the sweet high-fat diet. The addition of saccharin or sucrose solutions to the standard lab-chow diet had no effect.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results suggest that certain palatable diets may affect the development of, and recovery from, activity-based anorexia."

      Heightened threat sensitivity is a transdiagnostic feature in several psychiatric disorders. The neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to reduce fear related behaviours and facilitated fear extinction in animals. These findings have led to increasing interest to explore the effects of intranasal oxytocin on threat processing in humans.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The review included 26 studies (N = 1173), nine of which included clinical populations (N = 234). The clinical groups included were people with borderline personality disorder (BPD), anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, depression, anxiety, and alcohol dependence disorder. We examined the effects of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin on startle response, attentional responses, and behavioural responses to threat.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A single dose of intranasal oxytocin significantly increased the physiological startle response to threat in healthy people with a small effect size. However, oxytocin did not have significant effects on attentional bias towards social or disorder-specific threat, fixation towards threatening stimuli among healthy or clinical populations, or on threat related behavioural approach or avoidance responses.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      No studies investigated the effects of oxytocin on the startle response to threat among clinical populations. Additionally, only one of the reviewed studies had sufficient power to detect at least a moderate effect of oxytocin according to our criterion.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The synthesis of literature suggest that oxytocin may influence the salience of threatening stimuli among healthy individuals, increasing the startle response to threat. It would be of interest to investigate the effects of oxytocin on the startle response to threat among clinical populations."
['Petrovich GD.'],Learning and the motivation to eat: forebrain circuitry.,Physiol Behav,"Appetite and eating are not only controlled by energy needs, but also by extrinsic factors that are not directly related to energy balance. Environmental signals that acquire motivational properties through associative learning-learned cues-can override homeostatic signals and stimulate eating in sated states, or inhibit eating in states of hunger. Such influences are important, as environmental factors are believed to contribute to the increased susceptibility to overeating and the rise in obesity in the developed world. Similarly, environmental and social factors contribute to the onset and maintenance of anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders through interactions with the individual genetic background. Nevertheless, how learning enables environmental signals to control feeding, and the underlying brain mechanisms are poorly understood. We developed two rodent models to study how learned cues are integrated with homeostatic signals within functional forebrain networks, and how these networks are modulated by experience. In one model, a cue previously paired with food when an animal was hungry induces eating in sated rats. In the other model, food-deprived rats inhibit feeding when presented with a cue that signals danger, a tone previously paired with footshocks. Here evidence will be reviewed that the forebrain network formed by the amygdala, lateral hypothalamus and medial prefrontal cortex mediates cue-driven feeding, while a parallel amygdalar circuitry mediates suppression of eating by the fear cue. Findings from the animal models may be relevant for understanding aspects of human appetite and eating, and maladaptive mechanisms that could lead to overeating and anorexia."
['Haleem DJ.'],Exaggerated feedback control decreases brain serotonin concentration and elicits hyperactivity in a rat model of diet-restriction-induced anorexia nervosa.,Appetite,"5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) system is the major neurotransmitter system of interest in research on anorexia nervosa (AN). The AN patients show extreme dieting weight loss, hyperactivity and low basal levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a major metabolite of 5-HT in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Studies on animal models show that diet restriction (DR) decreases 5-HT metabolism in the brain and hypothalamus which is not necessarily associated with a decrease in the availability of essential amino acid tryptophan (TRP) the precursor of serotonin. To further investigate the mechanism involved in DR-induced decreases of 5-HT the present study uses 8-hydroxy-(2-di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a selective 5-HT-1A agonist, as a probe to monitor the responsiveness of negative feedback control over 5-HT metabolism. Effects of DR and of 8-OHDPAT on TRP, 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations are determined in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain known to role in the regulation of appetite. Animals of DR group given access to food 2h daily for 6 days exhibited 21.6% decrease in the body weight compared to freely feeding (FF) controls. The levels of TRP in the plasma and of 5-HT in the hypothalamus decreased. No effect was found on the levels of TRP in the hypothalamus. 8-OH-DPAT-induced decreases of 5-HT and 5-HIAA were greater in DR than FF group. 8-OH-DPAT-induced hyperactivity was also greater in DR than FF group. The results show that DR-induced decreases of 5-HT are due to an increase in the responsiveness of negative feedback control over 5-HT and not due to smaller availability of TRP. DR-induced increase in activity and 8-OH-DPAT-induced greater hyperactivity in DR than FF group may also be due to exaggerated negative feedback control over 5-HT. It is suggested that drugs decreasing the responsiveness of negative feedback control over 5-HT may be of use for the treatment and prevention of AN in under weight patients on restricted diet."

Two major groups of such disorders are anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). The etiology of EDs is complex and evidence indicates that both biological/genetic and psychosocial factors are involved. Several lines of evidence indicate that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating eating behaviors and cognitive impairments in the EDs. BDNF is involved in neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and survival during development. BDNF and its tyrosine kinase receptor (TrkB) are expressed in hypothalamic nuclei associated with eating behaviors. A series of studies using BDNF knockout mice and the human BDNF gene indicate an association of BDNF and EDs with predisposition and vulnerability. In the previous studies, serum BDNF levels in subjects with EDs are reduced significantly compared with healthy controls, hence, we proposed that levels of serum BDNF would be a useful diagnostic indicator for EDs."

['Swaab DF.'],Neuropeptides in hypothalamic neuronal disorders.,Int Rev Cytol,"A few examples of hypothalamic, peptidergic disorders leading to clinical signs and symptoms are presented in this review. Increased activity of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and decreased activity of the vasopressin neurons in the biological clock and of the thyroxine-releasing hormone (TRH) neurons in the PVN contribute to the signs and symptoms of depression. In men, the central nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) is about twice as large and contains twice as many somatostatin neurons as in women. In transsexuals this sex difference is reversed, pointing to a role of this structure in gender. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons are formed in the fetal olfactory placade and migrate along the terminal nerve fibers into the hypothalamus. In Kallmann's syndrome the migration process of the LHRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) neurons is aborted, which explains the joint occurrence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia in this syndrome. In postmenopausal women, the neurons of the infundibular nucleus hypertrophy and become hyperactive because of the disappearance of the estrogen feedback and contain hyperactive peptidergic neurons. Climacteric flushes may be caused by hyperactivity of the neurokinin-B or LHRH neurons in this nucleus. The hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the perifornical area are involved in sleep. In narcolepsy with cataplexy, a loss of these neurons, probably due to an autoimmune process, is found. Obese subjects with a mutation in the gene that encodes for leptin, the preproghrelin gene, or the alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) gene have been described. Decreased numbers and activity of the oxytocin neurons in the PVN may be responsible for the absence of satiety in Prader-Willi syndrome. Moreover, a glucocorticoid receptor polymorphism is associated with obesitas and dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. In contrast, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the AGRP gene have been associated with anorexia nervosa."
"['Mitchell JE', 'de Zwaan M', 'Roerig JL.']",Drug therapy for patients with eating disorders.,Curr Drug Targets CNS Neurol Disord,"The purpose of this article is to review the psychopharmacology treatment literature for patients with eating disorders including bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa and binge eating disorder. The best-developed treatment literature concerns bulimia nervosa, which has been studied now in several dozen pharmacological treatment studies. The agents most commonly used are the antidepressants, with particular focus on the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including fluoxetine hydrochloride. These agents clearly impact significantly on the frequency of abnormal eating behaviors such as binge eating and purging. However, subjects treated with these drugs rarely achieve remission. Pharmacotherapy of anorexia nervosa has also traditionally focused on the use of antidepressants and there is some evidence that the use of SSRIs may help in preventing relapse in weight restored patients. Recently interest has developed in the use of atypical neuroleptics to help with the obsessionality and resistance to treatment frequently seen in low weight patients, the most commonly employed agent being olanzapine. Pharmacotherapy of binge-eating disorder is now being intensively investigated. In general medication alone seems inferior to psychotherapy in the short term. Antidepressants can increase the amount of weight loss when combined with psychological treatment and also appear to benefit symptoms such as depression. Further data are needed, but a number of drugs appear promising."
"['Foldi CJ', 'Milton LK', 'Oldfield BJ.']",The Role of Mesolimbic Reward Neurocircuitry in Prevention and Rescue of the Activity-Based Anorexia (ABA) Phenotype in Rats.,Neuropsychopharmacology,"Patients suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN) become anhedonic; unable or unwilling to derive normal pleasures and avoid rewarding outcomes, most profoundly in food intake. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) model recapitulates many of the characteristics of the human condition, including anhedonia, and allows investigation of the underlying neurobiology of AN. The potential for increased neuronal activity in reward/hedonic circuits to prevent and rescue weight loss is investigated in this model. The mesolimbic pathway extending from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was activated using a dual viral strategy, involving retrograde transport of Cre (CAV-2-Cre) to the VTA and coincident injection of DREADD receptors (AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry). Systemic clozapine-n-oxide (CNO; 0.3 mg/kg) successfully recruited a large proportion of the VTA-NAc dopaminergic projections, with activity evidenced by colocalization with elevated levels of Fos protein. The effects of reward circuit activation on energy balance and predicted survival was investigated in female Sprague-Dawley rats, where free access to running wheels was paired with time-limited (90 min) access to food, a paradigm (ABA) which will cause anorexia and death if unchecked. Excitation of the reward pathway substantially increased food intake and food anticipatory activity (FAA) to prevent ABA-associated weight loss, while overall locomotor activity was unchanged. Similar activation of reward circuitry, delayed until establishment of the ABA phenotype, rescued rats from their precipitous weight loss. Although these data are consistent with shifts primarily in food intake, the contribution of mechanisms including energy expenditure to survival remains to be determined. These results will inform the neurobiological underpinnings of AN, and provide insight into the mechanisms of reward circuitry relevant to feeding and weight loss."
['de Angelis L.'],5-HT2A antagonists in psychiatric disorders.,Curr Opin Investig Drugs,"Several lines of evidence support a role for serotoninergic (5-HT) system abnormalities in the pathogenesis and treatment of several psychiatric disorders. This review summarizes information about the association between the 5-HT2A receptor gene and its relevance to schizophrenia, tardive dyskinesia, major depression, suicidality, anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Evidence is presented that implies that selective 5-HT2A antagonists may be considered useful in investigating the role of 5-HT2A receptor function and in the treatment of psychosis, and possibly alcohol and cocaine dependence. Additionally, findings are reviewed on the importance of 5-HT2A receptor antagonism in contributing to the therapeutic effect of several clinically effective and potential atypical antipsychotics as well as several antidepressants. In conclusion, the ability of selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonists to interfere with the heightened state of dopamine activity without altering basal tone, suggests that these drugs possess antipsychotic activity and may provide the basis for new therapies for psychosis and drug dependence, in addition to contributing towards a more complete understanding of 5-HT2A receptor function."

It increases food intake by interacting with hypothalamic and brainstem circuits involved in energy balance, as well as reward-related brain areas. A heightened gut-brain ghrelin axis is an emerging feature of certain eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and Prader-Willi syndrome. In common obesity, ghrelin levels are lowered, whereas post-meal ghrelin levels remain higher than in lean individuals. Agents that interfere with ghrelin signalling have therapeutic potential for eating disorders, including obesity. However, most of these drugs are only in the preclinical phase of development. Data obtained so far suggest that ghrelin agonists may have potential in the treatment of anorexia nervosa, while ghrelin antagonists seem promising for other eating disorders such as obesity and Prader-Willi syndrome. However, large clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these drugs."
"['Goebel-Stengel M', 'Wang L.']",Central and peripheral expression and distribution of NUCB2/nesfatin-1.,Curr Pharm Des,"Nesfatin-1 is the N-terminal fragment of nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2). The antibody against nesfatin-1 recognizes both full length of NUCB2 and nesfatin-1, thus the immunolabeling represents NUCB2/nesfatin-1. It has been found that NUCB2/nesfatin-1 is widely distributed in the rodent central nervous system. The immunoreactivity is more intensive in the brain autonomic centers that regulate feeding, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular functions, such as the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, locus coeruleus, dorsal vagal complex and medullary raphe nuclei. In neurons, NUCB2/nesfatin-1 is located in the soma and primary dendrites, not in nerve fibers. NUCB2/nesfatin-1 is co-localized with several neurotransmitters involved in regulation of food intake, autonomic and neuroendocrine functions, including oxytocin, vasopressin, neuropeptide Y, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript, proopiomelanocortin, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, melanin-concentrating hormone, leptin, mammalian target of rapamycin, urocortin-1, corticotropin-releasing factor and serotonin. In the periphery, NUCB2/nesfatin-1 is located mainly in the pituitary, gastric mucosa where it coexists with ghrelin, and pancreatic endocrine cells containing insulin. Nesfatin-1 is detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid of rats. NUCB2/nesfatin-1 is measurable in the plasma, and altered under different conditions in rodents and humans, such as immune challenge, high fat diet and exercise, anorexia nervosa, anxiety and depression. Anatomical data suggest that nesfatin-1 is a unique neuroendocrine peptide that may be involved in regulation of homeostasis."
['Reinehr T.'],Obesity and thyroid function.,Mol Cell Endocrinol,"A moderate elevation of thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations, which is associated with triiodothyronine (T3) values in or slightly above the upper normal range, is frequently found in obese humans. These alterations seem rather a consequence than a cause of obesity since weight loss leads to a normalization of elevated thyroid hormone levels. Elevated thyroid hormone concentrations increase the resting energy expenditure (REE). The underlying pathways are not fully understood. As a consequence of the increased REE, the availability of accumulated energy for conversion into fat is diminished. In conclusion, the alterations of thyroid hormones in obesity suggest an adaptation process. Since rapid weight loss is associated with a decrease of TSH and T3, the resulting decrease in REE may contribute towards the difficulties maintaining weight loss. Leptin seems to be a promising link between obesity and alterations of thyroid hormones since leptin concentrations influence TSH release."
['Bessesen DH.'],Regulation of body weight: what is the regulated parameter?,Physiol Behav,"Despite dramatic variations in day to day intake and energy expenditure, weight remains relatively stable in most animals and humans. There are clear physiological responses to over and underfeeding suggesting that the body strives to maintain a constant weight. Despite this, for most humans and experimental animals, there is a tendency for weight to increase slowly over the lifespan. Recent increases in the prevalence of both obesity and anorexia nervosa suggest that factors other than homeostatic physiological mechanisms are important in determining body weight. Clearly reward pathways are activated by palatable food and evidence is emerging that energy balance can modulate these reward pathways and alter the salience of food related stimuli. Significant inhibitory control of reward pathways also comes from a number of brain regions involved in regulation of behavior. Finally there is strong evidence of the important role that social and environmental factors play in modulating both food intake and physical activity behaviors which in turn result in alterations in weight over time. While some aspects of these regulatory systems are within the conscious awareness of people, many, perhaps even most are not. The evidence then would suggest that weight is controlled by several complex regulatory systems that respond to internal metabolic and hormonal signals, hedonic properties of food, internal forces of valuation and self-control, and social factors. Each of these systems is likely 'regulated' and is important in ultimately determining body weight. Experimental paradigms that test one variable in one of these interrelated systems should, where possible control or at least consider the other systems in an effort to provide an integrated picture of weight regulation."

Here, we determined trait differences in the development of activity-based anorexia between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred mouse lines previously reported as having low and high anxiety, respectively. C57BL/6J mice housed with running wheels and exposed to scheduled feeding reduced their wheel activity, in contrast to DBA/2J mice which exhibited increased behavioural activity under these conditions. Food restriction induced hypoleptinemia in both strains, but the decline in plasma leptin was stronger in DBA/2J mice and correlated with increased activity only in that strain. These data suggest that plasma leptin level dynamics rather than hypoleptinemia alone influences the development of activity-based anorexia and that recombinant inbred panels based on these progenitor lines offer opportunities for the identification of molecular determinants for anorexia nervosa related behavioural traits."

However, few studies have used this animal model to investigate the biological basis for vulnerability of pubertal and adolescent females to ABA, even though the great majority of the anorexia nervosa cases are females exhibiting the first symptoms during puberty. GABAergic inhibition of the hippocampus strongly regulates anxiety as well as plasticity throughout life. We recently showed that the hippocampal CA1 of female mice undergo a dramatic change at puberty onset--from expressing virtually none of the nonsynaptic α4βδ GABA(A) receptors (GABARs) prepubertally to expressing these GABARs at ~7% of the CA1 dendritic spine membranes at puberty onset. Furthermore, we showed that this change underlies the enhanced modulation of anxiety, neuronal excitability, and NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus by the stress neurosteroid, THP (3α-OH-5α[β]-pregnan-20-one or [allo]pregnanolone). Here, we used quantitative electron microscopy to determine whether ABA induction in female rats during adolescence also elevates the expression of α4 and δ subunits of α4βδ GABARs, as was observed at puberty onset for mice. Our analysis revealed that rats also exhibit a rise of α4 and δ subunits of α4βδ GABARs at puberty onset, in that these subunits are detectable at ~6% of the dendritic spine membranes of CA1 pyramidal cells at puberty onset (postnatal day 32-36; P32-36) but this drops to about 2% by P40-P44. The levels of α4 and δ subunits at the CA1 spines remained low following exposure of females to either of the two environmental factors needed to generate ABA--food restriction and access to a running wheel for 4 days--from P40 to P44. This pattern contrasted greatly from those of ABA animals, for which the two environmental factors were combined. Within the hippocampus of ABA animals, 12% of the spine profiles were labeled for α4, reflecting a sixfold increase, relative to hippocampi of age-matched (P44) control females (p < 0.005). Concurrently, 7% of the spine profiles were labeled for δ, reflecting a 130% increase from the control values of 3% (p = 0.01). No measurable change was detected for spine size. The observed magnitude of increase in the α4 and δ subunits at spines is sufficient to increase both tonic inhibition of hippocampus and anxiety during stress, thereby likely to exacerbate hyperactivity and weight loss."

      Activity-based anorexia is a translational rodent model that results in severe weight loss, hyperactivity, and voluntary self-starvation. The goal of our investigation was to identify vulnerable and resistant phenotypes of activity-based anorexia in adolescent female rats.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained under conditions of restricted access to food (N = 64; or unlimited access, N = 16) until experimental exit, predefined as a target weight loss of 30-35% or meeting predefined criteria for animal health. Nonlinear mixed effects statistical modeling was used to describe wheel running behavior, time to event analysis was used to assess experimental exit, and a regressive partitioning algorithm was used to classify phenotypes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Objective criteria were identified for distinguishing novel phenotypes of activity-based anorexia, including a vulnerable phenotype that conferred maximal hyperactivity, minimal food intake, and the shortest time to experimental exit, and a resistant phenotype that conferred minimal activity and the longest time to experimental exit.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The identification of objective criteria for defining vulnerable and resistant phenotypes of activity-based anorexia in adolescent female rats provides an important framework for studying the neural mechanisms that promote vulnerability to or protection against the development of self-starvation and hyperactivity during adolescence. Ultimately, future studies using these novel phenotypes may provide important translational insights into the mechanisms that promote these maladaptive behaviors characteristic of anorexia nervosa."

Many reproductive pathologies such as anorexia nervosa, dystocia and preeclampsia, have been linked to body mass index and to metabolic syndrome. Lipid metabolism has also been associated with ovarian, uterine and placental functions. Among the regulators of lipid homeostasis, the Liver X Receptors (LXRs) and the Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1), two members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, play a central role. LXRs are sensitive to intracellular cholesterol concentration and decrease plasma cholesterol, allowing to considering them as ""cholesterol sensors"". LRH-1 shares many target-genes with LXRs and has been considered for a long time as a real orphan nuclear receptor, but recent findings showed that phospholipids are ligands for this nuclear receptor. Acting in concert, LXRs and LRH-1 could thus be sensitive to slight modifications in cellular lipid balance, tightly maintaining their cellular concentrations. These last years, the use of transgenic mice clarified the roles of these nuclear receptors in many physiological functions. This review will be focused on the roles of LXRs and LRH-1 on female reproduction. Their contribution to ovarian endocrine and exocrine functions, as well as uterine and placental physiology will be discussed. The future challenge will thus be to target these nuclear receptors to prevent lipid-associated reproductive diseases in women."

The etiology of these diseases is not fully understood, but a growing body of literature suggests that stress and anxiety may play a critical role in their development. As our understanding of the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to disease in clinical populations like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder continue to grow, neuroscientists are using animal models to understand the neurobiology of stress and feeding. We hypothesize that eating disorder clinical phenotypes may result from stress-induced maladaptive alterations in neural circuits that regulate feeding, and that these circuits can be neurochemically isolated using animal model of eating disorders."

The neuronal mediators of Nts anorectic action are now beginning to be understood, and, as such, modulating specific Nts pathways might be useful in treating feeding and body weight disorders. This review considers mechanisms through which Nts normally regulates feeding and how disruptions in Nts signaling might contribute to the disordered feeding and body weight of schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, anorexia nervosa, and obesity. Defining how Nts specifically mediates feeding vs. other aspects of physiology will inform the design of therapeutics that modify body weight without disrupting other important Nts-mediated physiology."

We hypothesized that SIH is triggered by the decline in leptin secretion associated with food restriction. To test this hypothesis, rats, which had established a stable level of activity, were treated with leptin or vehicle via implanted minipumps concomitantly to initiation of food restriction for 7 days. In a second experiment treatment was initiated after SIH had already set in. In contrast to the vehicle-treated rats, which increased their baseline activity level by 300%, the development of SIH was suppressed by leptin. Furthermore, leptin was able to stop SIH, after it had set in. These results underscore the assumed major role of leptin in the adaptation to semi-starvation. Because SIH has been viewed as a model for anorexia nervosa, we also assessed subjective ratings of motor restlessness in 30 patients with this eating disorder in the emaciated state associated with hypoleptinemia and after increments in leptin secretion brought upon by therapeutically induced weight gain. Hypoleptinemic patients ranked their motor restlessness higher than upon attainment of their maximal leptin level during inpatient treatment. Thus, hypoleptinemia might also contribute to the hyperactivity frequently associated with anorexia nervosa."
"['Khan SM', 'Hamnvik OP', 'Brinkoetter M', 'Mantzoros CS.']",Leptin as a modulator of neuroendocrine function in humans.,Yonsei Med J,"Leptin, a peptide hormone secreted by adipocytes in proportion of the amount of energy stored in fat, plays a central role in regulating human energy homeostasis. In addition, leptin plays a significant permissive role in the physiological regulation of several neuroendocrine axes, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal, -thyroid, -growth hormone, and -adrenal axes. Decreased levels of leptin, also known as hypoleptinemia, signal to the brain a state of energy deprivation. Hypoleptinemia can be a congenital or acquired condition, and is associated with alterations of the aforementioned axes aimed at promoting survival. More specifically, gonadotropin levels decrease and become less pulsatile under conditions of energy deprivation, and these changes can be at least partially reversed through leptin administration in physiological replacement doses. Similarly, leptin deficiency is associated with thyroid axis abnormalities including abnormal levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and leptin administration may at least partially attenuate this effect. Leptin deficiency results in decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 levels which can be partially ameliorated through leptin administration, and leptin appears to have a much more pronounced effect on the growth of rodents than that of humans. Similarly, adrenal axis function is regulated more tightly by low leptin in rodents than in humans. In addition to congenital leptin deficiency, conditions that may be associated with decreased leptin levels include hypothalamic amenorrhea, anorexia nervosa, and congenital or acquired lipodystrophy syndromes. Accumulating evidence from proof of concept studies suggests that leptin administration, in replacement doses, may ameliorate neuroendocrine abnormalities in individuals who suffer from these conditions."
['Butera PC.'],Estradiol and the control of food intake.,Physiol Behav,"Gonadal steroids are among the many factors that influence food intake and body weight in mammals. Hormonal effects on these processes are particularly striking in female rats, which show large increases in food intake and body weight after ovariectomy. A key role of estradiol in the control of food intake and energy balance in humans is evidenced by the fact that the incidence of obesity increases greatly after menopause [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Body mass index and insulin resistance. Obstet Gynecol 2004;104:5s-10]. The actions of estradiol on neural systems that regulate eating may also account in part for sex differences in food intake and eating disorders, which occur much more frequently in young women [Sodersten P, Bergh C. Anorexia nervosa: towards a neurobiologically based therapy. Eur J Pharmacol 2003;480:67-74]. This paper presents a minireview of research examining the changes in feeding that occur during the ovarian cycle, the effects of estradiol withdrawal and replacement on food intake and body weight, and the neurobiological mechanisms by which estradiol influences feeding behavior. A model of hormone action on food intake that emerges from this research views estradiol as an indirect control of eating and meal size, producing changes in feeding behavior by modulating the central processing of both satiating and orexigenic peptides that represent direct controls of eating. Some of the shortcomings of the model and directions for future research are discussed."

No approved pharmacological treatments exist for AN despite high mortality rates. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) phenomenon models aspects of AN in rodents, including progressive weight loss, reduced food intake, and hyperactivity. First, we optimized the ABA paradigm for mice. We compared mouse strains (Balb/cJ, A/J) for susceptibility with ABA, and evaluated the effects of different food access durations (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h) on ABA parameters. Balb/cJ mice exhibited significantly shorter survival time (days until 25% bodyweight loss) in the ABA paradigm compared with A/J mice. Furthermore, 6 h of food access reduced survival in mice housed with wheels without reducing survival in mice housed without wheels. We then evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with fluoxetine (4 weeks) or subchronic treatment with olanzapine (OLZ) (1 week) on ABA in BALB/cJ mice. OLZ (12 mg/kg/day) significantly increased survival and reduced food anticipatory activity (FAA). However, OLZ did not alter food intake or running wheel activity during ad-lib feeding (baseline) or restriction conditions, or in mice housed without wheels. Fluoxetine (18 mg/kg/day) increased food intake and reduced FAA, but did not alter survival. Here, we report for the first time that OLZ, but not fluoxetine, reduces ABA in mice. Our findings indicate further need for clinical investigations into the effects of OLZ, but not selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, on core features of AN."

Lactic bacteria can induce interferon (IFN) production in human healthy subjects, thus, a better protection against infections would be expected. Therefore, we planned to evaluate the effect of two diets including yoghurt or milk on IFN-gamma production during nutritional recovery in two different situations of malnutrition: (1) children with diarrhoea; and (2) patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). Both the diet including yoghurt of that including milk seemed to increase IFN-gamma production at the end of nutritional recovery in the malnourished children with diarrhoea. The significance of interferon production and the lymphocyte subset increase should be explored to know if a better resistance against pathogens is related to them. Regulation of intestinal absorption and moderate stimulation of interferon production make the yoghurt-based diet a good choice in the nutritional care of children. In the same way, an increase in the IFN-gamma production was observed in AN patients consuming yoghurt. This increase of IFN-gamma production could be considered a biological marker to detect the effect of probiotics on the immune response, especially in the improvement of a deficient nutritional status."

It plays an important role to improve and control a number of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, hyperactivity and behavioral impulsivity. Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is one of the psychiatric disorder which is associated with diet. In AN, patients show extreme dieting, weight loss, hyperactivity, depression/anxiety, self-control and behavioral impulsivity. Previous studies showed that during diet restriction, tryptophan decreases serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) metabolism in the brain due to its less availability and contributes psychiatric problems associated with AN. The present study is designed to investigate the effects of tryptophan administration on 5-HT metabolism in diet-restricted rats. Tryptophan at a dose of 50 or 100mg/kg was given orally to respective freely fed (FF) or diet restricted (DR) animals daily for five weeks. Behavioral activities were also monitored weekly. The results show significant effect (p<0.05) on behavior in activity box, open field and in light/dark transition test by tryptophan administration in diet-restricted rats. This may be associated with the increased in serum tryptophan and brain 5-HT metabolism. Therefore, it is concluded that diet-restriction-induced behavioral changes might be reverted back with the administration of tryptophan and may be helpful to improve psychological problems in AN."

Since its discovery tremendous research efforts have been directed at unraveling ghrelin's mechanisms of action, revealing that ghrelin is a pleiotropic hormone implicated in myriad of molecular signaling mechanisms. Accordingly, ghrelin is the only known circulating peripheral hormone with the ability to promote a positive energy balance by stimulating food intake while decreasing energy expenditure and body fat utilization. Moreover, beyond its ability to promote the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary, ghrelin stimulates gut motility and gastric acid secretion, modulates sleep, taste sensation and behavior, and regulates glucose metabolism. Due to ghrelin's ability to promote body weight gain and adiposity via centrally mediated signaling mechanisms, modulation of the endogenous ghrelin system is considered a promising strategy to treat individuals with pathologically reduced body weight, such as patients with anorexia nervosa or cachexia. The aim of this chapter is to summarize the current knowledge of how ghrelin affects systemic energy metabolism."

A symptom may be presumed to be a psychological manifestation of the eating disorder and inappropriately dismissed for further medical evaluation. Alternatively, a detailed medical workup may be performed, overlooking a classic relationship between starvation and a physical finding, which delays referral to eating disorder care. This review article focuses on rare medical issues (also called ""zebras"" in medical training), diagnoses that may be missed in patients with eating disorders, and best practices for management, organized by organ system.

      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric condition characterized by excessive body weight loss and disturbed perceptions of body shape and size, often associated with excessive physical activity. There is currently no effective drug-related therapy of this disease and this leads to high relapse rate. Clinical data suggest that a promising therapy to treat and reduce reoccurrence of AN may be based on the use of drugs that target the endocannabinoid (EC) system, which appears dysregulated in AN patients.
    


          Experimental approach:
        
      
      The activity-based anorexia (ABA) rodent model mimics the severe body weight loss and increased physical activity, as well as the neuroendocrine disturbances (i.e. hypoleptinaemia and hypercortisolaemia) in AN. This study investigated whether cannabinoid agonists can effectively modify anorexic-like behaviours and neuroendocrine changes in rats subjected to a repeated ABA regime that mimics the human condition in which patients repeatedly undergo a recovery and illness cycle.
    


          Key results:
        
      
      Our data show that subchronic treatment with both the natural CB1 /CB2 receptor agonist Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol and the synthetic CB1 /CB2 receptor agonist CP-55,940 significantly reduced body weight loss and running wheel activity in ABA rats. These behavioural effects were accompanied by an increase in leptin signalling and a decrease in plasma levels of corticosterone.
    


          Conclusion and implications:
        
      
      Taken together, our results further demonstrate the involvement of the EC system in AN pathophysiology and that strategies which modulate EC signalling are useful to treat this disorder, specifically in patients where physical hyperactivity plays a central role in its progression and maintenance."

Although acute loss of hypothalamic neurons that produce appetite-stimulating neuropeptide Y (Npy) and agouti-related peptide (Agrp) in adult mice or in mice homozygous for the anorexia (anx) mutation causes aphagia, our understanding of the factors that help maintain appetite regulatory circuitry is limited. Here we identify a mutation (C19T) that converts an arginine to a tryptophan (R7W) in the TYRO3 protein tyrosine kinase 3 (Tyro3) gene, which resides within the anx critical interval, as contributing to the severity of anx phenotypes. Our observation that, like Tyro3-/- mice, anx/anx mice exhibit abnormal secondary platelet aggregation suggested that the C19T Tyro3 variant might have functional consequences. Tyro3 is expressed in the hypothalamus and other brain regions affected by the anx mutation, and its mRNA localization appeared abnormal in anx/anx brains by postnatal day 19 (P19). The presence of wild-type Tyro3 transgenes, but not an R7W-Tyro3 transgene, doubled the weight and lifespans of anx/anx mice and near-normal numbers of hypothalamic Npy-expressing neurons were present in Tyro3-transgenic anx/anx mice at P19. Although no differences in R7W-Tyro3 signal sequence function or protein localization were discernible in vitro, distribution of R7W-Tyro3 protein differed from that of Tyro3 protein in the cerebellum of transgenic wild-type mice. Thus, R7W-Tyro3 protein localization deficits are only detectable in vivo Further analyses revealed that the C19T Tyro3 mutation is present in a few other mouse strains, and hence is not the causative anx mutation, but rather an anx modifier. Our work shows that Tyro3 has prosurvival roles in the appetite regulatory circuitry and could also provide useful insights towards the development of interventions targeting detrimental weight loss."

Its effects on regional vasopressin and oxytocin concentrations were determined under basal conditions and following systemic fluoxetine. Weight-matched, exercised and unexercised rats served as controls. Fluoxetine caused abnormalities in suprachiasmatic vasopressin and dynorphin A content and in thymus oxytocin content that did not occur in weight-matched or exercised controls. No syndrome-specific anomalies occurred in the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system or dorsal vagal complex (DVC). However, weight reduction and fluoxetine increased circulating vasopressin; moderate exercise caused fluoxetine-induced elevations in posterior pituitary vasopressin and oxytocin; and, unlike the other groups, fluoxetine increased DVC oxytocin in freely fed unexercised rats. It was concluded that syndrome-specific vasopressin and oxytocin abnormalities occur that are not secondary to weight loss or moderate exercise; that weight loss or fluoxetine increases circulating vasopressin; that moderate exercise alters neurohypophysial vasopressin and oxytocin content; and that weight loss or exercise inhibits a fluoxetine-stimulated increase in DVC oxytocin.

These included a basal elevation in plasma beta-endorphin, which was abnormally suppressed by 2DG, and 2DG-induced elevations in arcuate hypothalamic beta-endorphin content and supraoptic hypothalamic dynorphin-A content. None of these changes occurred in controls. Finally, it was found that short-term moderate exercise itself chronically reduced adenohypophysial beta-endorphin content and elevated supraoptic dynorphin-A content. The relationship of the syndrome's hyperendorphinism to the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and the auto-addiction hypothesis of anorexia nervosa was considered, as was the significance of the supraoptic dynorphin-A abnormality to the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system.

"['Chen J', 'Papies EK', 'Barsalou LW.']",A core eating network and its modulations underlie diverse eating phenomena.,Brain Cogn,"We propose that a core eating network and its modulations account for much of what is currently known about the neural activity underlying a wide range of eating phenomena in humans (excluding homeostasis and related phenomena). The core eating network is closely adapted from a network that Kaye, Fudge, and Paulus (2009) proposed to explain the neurocircuitry of eating, including a ventral reward pathway and a dorsal control pathway. In a review across multiple literatures that focuses on experiments using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we first show that neural responses to food cues, such as food pictures, utilize the same core eating network as eating. Consistent with the theoretical perspective of grounded cognition, food cues activate eating simulations that produce reward predictions about a perceived food and potentially motivate its consumption. Reviewing additional literatures, we then illustrate how various factors modulate the core eating network, increasing and/or decreasing activity in subsets of its neural areas. These modulating factors include food significance (palatability, hunger), body mass index (BMI, overweight/obesity), eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating), and various eating goals (losing weight, hedonic pleasure, healthy living). By viewing all these phenomena as modulating a core eating network, it becomes possible to understand how they are related to one another within this common theoretical framework. Finally, we discuss future directions for better establishing the core eating network, its modulations, and their implications for behavior."

This shows that his seminal ideas grew out of his astute observation of psychiatric signs and symptoms. Later on, he observed the broad spectrum of human epileptic seizures and its cause in the limbic system. A large variety of uncontrolled feelings and emotions, together with bizarre motor behavior, is elicited by seizures in the hippocampus and other limbic structures.Meanwhile, based on the triune brain model, a new approach to psychopathology has taken shape. It is the evolutionary perspective of mental diseases such as the major psychoses, anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorders, and also brain diseases such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease. Many mental illnesses are marked by severe deficits in social behavior and social communication. The social communication system disintegrates, especially in the major psychoses. The response choices to social or other external signals in a given situation become limited or even distorted, and reasoning is no longer part of decision making. The emphasis of this contribution is on the disintegration of social behavior in psychopathology, based on evolutionary psychiatry. MacLean's concept provides valuable insight for understanding the biological roots of human social behavior and communication.

Moreover, by acting on vagal afferents or centrally, ghrelin can activate hypothalamic arcuate neurons that secrete the orexigenic peptides neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide, and inhibit the anorexigenic neurons secreting pro-opiomelanocortin and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. The orexigenic signalling pathway of ghrelin involves adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. It has been proposed that ghrelin can also increase dopaminergic transmission from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, leading to augmentation of afferent reward signals. Present evidence suggests that ghrelin plays an important role in obesity, eating disorders, and cachexia, as well as in regulating appetite and energy balance in healthy individuals. In pathological states, ghrelin can be lower than normal as is seen in obese individuals, or can be higher than normal as has been reported for Prader-Willi syndrome, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and certain types of cachexia. In the future, the application of compounds targeting the ghrelin pathway could involve the use of pharmacotherapies of ghrelin agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists, neutralisation of ghrelin by vaccines and spiegelmers, desacyl ghrelin analogues, as well as inhibitors of the GOAT enzyme which attaches the lipid modification to desacyl ghrelin to synthetise ghrelin."

Using a modified version of the activity-based animal model of anorexia nervosa, we examine whether factors known to affect HPA axis activity influence the development of activity-based anorexia (ABA). Male and female rats were subjected to maternal separation or handling procedures during the first two postnatal weeks and tested in a mild version of the ABA paradigm, comprised of 2-hr daily running wheel access followed by 1-hr food access, either in adolescence or adulthood. Compared to handled females, maternally separated females demonstrated greater increases in wheel running and a more pronounced running-induced suppression of food intake during adolescence, but not in adulthood. In contrast, it was only in adulthood that wheel running produced more prolonged anorexic effects in maternally separated than in handled males. These findings highlight the interplay between early postnatal treatment, sex of the animal, and developmental age on running, food intake, and rate of body weight loss in a mild version of the ABA paradigm."

Zinc deficiency induces a number of physiological problems, including anorexia, growth retardation, dermatitis, taste disorder, and hypogonadism. Although it is clear that zinc deficiency produces specific and profound anorexia in experimental animals, the connection between zinc deficiency and anorexia is less certain. We were the first to show that orally, but not intraperitoneally, administered zinc rapidly stimulates food intake through orexigenic peptides coupled to the afferent vagus nerve using rats during early-stage zinc deficiency without decreased zinc concentrations in plasma and tissues. We confirmed that a zinc-sufficient diet containing zinc chloride acutely stimulated food intake after short-term zinc deprivation. We also found that orally administered zinc sulfate increased the expression of NPY and orexin mRNA after administration. Using vagotomized rats, we tested whether the increase in food intake after oral administration of zinc was mediated by the vagus nerve. In sham-operated rats, the oral administration of zinc stimulated food intake, whereas zinc and saline administrations did not exhibit differing effects in vagotomized rats. We conclude that zinc stimulates food intake in short-term zinc-deficient rats through the afferent vagus nerve with subsequent effects on hypothalamic peptides associated with food intake regulation. In this review, we describe recent research investigating the roles of zinc as an appetite stimulator in food intake regulation, along with research about hypothalamus, ghrelin, leptin and zinc receptor, and clinical application about anorexia nervosa, cachexia and sarcopenia. The article also presents some promising patents on zinc."

These behaviors are typical of persons with anorexia nervosa. Activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is known to be elevated in anorexia nervosa. We investigated the status of this axis in activity-based anorexia. Meal fed-control (MFC) and meal fed-wheel running (MFWR) rats were given access to food for 90 min daily; MFWR animals were allowed access to an activity wheel the remainder of the day. The experiment terminated when MFWR animals reached 75% of preexperimental body weight (males 3.9 +/- 0.3 d; females 4.2 +/- 0.2 d). Male and female MFWR rats consumed less food than MFC animals, while maintaining a high level of wheel running. Corticosterone concentrations were significantly elevated in MFWR animals. Corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA concentrations in the paraventricular nucleus were not different. Relative adrenal gland weights were greater and thymus gland weights were lower in MFWR animals. Changes in food intake could not be explained by differences in insulin, glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate or norepinephrine concentrations. Our results suggest increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in activity-based anorexia."

In addition, clinical studies suggest a possible role for 5-HT in the etiology of anorexia nervosa. Recently, we have examined the effects of pharmacological manipulation of the 5-HT system in female rats exposed to conditions that promote activity-based anorexia (ABA). In this animal model of anorexia nervosa, rats are food restricted (2 h access/day) while given the opportunity to exercise in running wheels. These conditions promote symptoms of anorexia nervosa including hypophagia, hyperactivity, progressive weight loss, and disruptions of the ovarian reproductive cycle. Previously, we demonstrated that increased 5-HT activity increased the weight loss associated with ABA in female rats. Here, we investigated whether decreased 5-HT activity would attenuate symptoms of ABA. Food-restricted female rats received injections of 8-OH-DPAT, a drug that reduces serotonergic neurotransmission, or saline vehicle 40 min prior to food access. During this restricted-feeding phase, food intake was similar between groups; however, 8-OH-DPAT prevented the hyperactivity observed in saline-treated rats. This resulted in less weight loss in 8-OH-DPAT-treated rats, suggesting that decreased activation of the 5-HT system attenuates the development of ABA."
"['Blüher S', 'Mantzoros CS.']",Leptin in humans: lessons from translational research.,Am J Clin Nutr,"Leptin has emerged over the past decade as a key hormone in not only the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure but also in the regulation of neuroendocrine and immune function as well as the modulation of glucose and fat metabolism as shown by numerous observational and interventional studies in humans with (complete) congenital or relative leptin deficiency. These results have led to proof-of-concept studies that have investigated the effect of leptin administration in subjects with complete (congenital) leptin deficiency caused by mutations in the leptin gene as well as in humans with relative leptin deficiency, including states of lipoatrophy or negative energy balance and neuroendocrine dysfunction, as for instance seen with hypothalamic amenorrhea in states of exercise-induced weight loss. In those conditions, most neuroendocrine, metabolic, or immune disturbances can be restored by leptin administration. Leptin replacement therapy is thus a promising approach in several disease states, including congenital complete leptin deficiency, states of energy deprivation, including anorexia nervosa or milder forms of hypothalamic amenorrhea, as well as syndromes of insulin resistance seen in conditions such as congenital or acquired lipodystrophy. In contrast, states of energy excess such as garden-variety obesity are associated with hyperleptinemia that reflects either leptin tolerance or leptin resistance. For those conditions, development of leptin sensitizers is currently a focus of pharmaceutical research. This article summarizes our current understanding of leptin's role in human physiology and its potential role as a novel therapeutic option in human disease states associated with a new hormone deficiency, ie, leptin deficiency."
['Koob GF.'],"Corticotropin-releasing factor, norepinephrine, and stress.",Biol Psychiatry,"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and related peptides in the central nervous system appears to have activating properties on behavior and to enhance behavioral responses to stressors. CRF and urocortin injected into the brain produces increases in arousal as measured by locomotor activation and increased responsiveness to stressful stimuli. These effects of CRF appear to be independent of the pituitary adrenal axis and can be reversed by specific and selective CRF antagonists alpha-helical CRF9-41 and D-Phe CRF12-41. Perhaps more importantly, CRF antagonists can reverse behavioral responses to many stressors. These results suggest that endogenous CRF systems in the brain may have a role in mediating behavioral responses to stressors. Norepinephrine systems emanating from the nucleus locus coeruleus also long have been hypothesized to be involved in mediating behavioral constructs associated with alertness, arousal, and stress. Pharmacologic, physiologic, and neuroanatomic evidence supports an important role for a CRF-norepinephrine interaction in the region of the locus coeruleus in response to stressors that may be modality-specific where CRF neurons activate the locus coeruleus. One may hypothesize that another norepinephrine-CRF interaction may occur in the terminal projections of the forebrain norepinephrine systems in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the central nucleus of the amygdala where norepinephrine stimulates CRF release. Such a feed-forward system may be particularly important in situations where an organism must mobilize not only the pituitary adrenal system but also the central nervous system, in response to environmental challenge. However, such a feed-forward mechanism in a fundamental brain-activating system may be particularly vulnerable to dysfunction and thus, may be the key to a variety of pathophysiologic conditions involving abnormal responses to stressors such as anorexia nervosa, anxiety, and affective disorders."

Although most candidate-gene association studies have not been able to identify ghrelin gene variants as being significantly associated with either AN or BN, some ghrelin variants may be associated with BN in Japanese. Furthermore, a significant association of a GHSR gene variant with BN and that of a GOAT gene variant with AN have been found. However, there have been relatively few studies, tested variants are restricted, and sample sizes are often modest. Therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of ghrelin-related gene variants in the predisposition and pathology of eating disorders."
"['Mercer LP', 'Kelley DS', 'Haq A', 'Humphries LL.']",Dietary induced anorexia: a review of involvement of the histaminergic system.,J Am Coll Nutr,"This review examines possible relationships between anorexia, dietary intake and central nervous system histaminergic activity. The hypothesis being reviewed is that one component of normal or pathophysiological neuroregulation of food intake involves histaminergic activity in the central nervous system, as influenced by concentrations and bioperiodicities of histamine and/or histamine receptors. Changes in concentrations of receptors are gender specific. Low protein quality or quantity diets elevate both central histamine and histamine receptors (H1) in rats while significantly decreasing their food intake. When injected with histaminergic antagonists, rats fed low protein diets increase food intake and have improved efficiency of weight gain. This review supports a dual hypotheses: central histaminergic activity is involved in the regulation of food intake, but food intake patterns (including dietary composition or energy content) can modify central histaminergic activity. This review also suggests that modified histamine and/or H1 receptor concentrations are potential mechanisms for elevated central histaminergic activity in food intake-related pathophysiological states. Thus, dietary interventions (clinically- or self-imposed) which modify food intake or diet composition have the potential of affecting the histaminergic system. Also, drugs with antihistaminergic properties have the potential of affecting food intake/weight gain patterns by interfering with normal neurochemical signals."

The neuropsychological constructs introduced within the research domain criteria (RDoC) matrix offer new hope for determining the neural substrate underlying the biological predisposition to EDs.

Reward pathways and the endocannabionid system have been implicated in the mediation of food intake. The potential to exploit these systems to reverse weight loss is investigated in a rodent model of activity-based anorexia (ABA). The effect of subchronic (6 days) Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) treatment (0.1, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/kg/day) was assessed on chow and high-fat diet (HFD) intake, body weight, running wheel activity (RWA) as well as thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and lipid metabolism in white adipose tissue (WAT). Limited time availability of food and continuous access to running wheels led to anorexia and significantly reduced body weight. THC treatment (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg/day) transiently stimulated chow intake with a moderate effect on RWA. THC (2.0 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced body weight loss and shifted markers of thermogenesis in BAT and lipid metabolism in WAT in directions consistent with reduced energy expenditure and lipolysis. THC (2.0 mg/kg/day) combined with HFD, produced a transient increase in food intake, reduction in RWA, attenuation of body weight loss, and changes in markers of thermogensis in BAT and lipolysis in the WAT. These changes were significantly greater than those seen in vehicle (HFD), vehicle (chow), and THC (chow)-treated animals. These data show for the first time the effectiveness of the endocannabinoid system in attenuating the weight loss associated with the development of ABA via a mechanism involving reduced energy expenditure."
"['McClelland J', 'Bozhilova N', 'Campbell I', 'Schmidt U.']",A systematic review of the effects of neuromodulation on eating and body weight: evidence from human and animal studies.,Eur Eat Disord Rev,"Background:
        
      
      Eating disorders (ED) are chronic and sometimes deadly illnesses. Existing treatments have limited proven efficacy, especially in the case of adults with anorexia nervosa (AN). Emerging neural models of ED provide a rationale for more targeted, brain-directed interventions.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      This systematic review has examined the effects of neuromodulation techniques on eating behaviours and body weight and assessed their potential for therapeutic use in ED.
    


          Method:
        
      
      All articles in PubMed, PsychInfo and Web of Knowledge were considered and screened against a priori inclusion/exclusion criteria. The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) were examined across studies in ED samples, other psychiatric and neurological disorders, and animal models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty studies were identified. There is evidence for ED symptom reduction following rTMS and DBS in both AN and bulimia nervosa. Findings from studies of other psychiatric and neurological disorders and from animal studies demonstrate that increases in food intake and body weight can be achieved following DBS and that VNS has potential value as a means of controlling eating and inducing weight loss.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Neuromodulation tools have potential for reducing ED symptomatology and related behaviours, and for altering food intake and body weight. In response to such findings, and emerging neural models of ED, treatment approaches are highly unlikely to remain 'brainless'. More research is required to evaluate the potential of neuromodulation procedures for improving long-term outcomes in ED."

      One quarter of patients with anorexia nervosa have a poor outcome and continue to suffer chronically or die. Electrical brain stimulation may be of therapeutic benefit in some of these patients; however, the brain target for inducing symptom relief is unknown. In this study, the authors evaluated the effects of acute and chronic electrical stimulation in the lateral hypothalamus on food intake, locomotor activity, and survival time in rats in an activity-based anorexia model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In an acute experiment, the authors electrically stimulated at 100 Hz and 0, 25, 50 and 75% of the maximal stimulation amplitude (that is, the amplitude leading to severe side effects) in the lateral hypothalamus on consecutive days during 4 test sessions in 10 rats and evaluated food intake and locomotor activity. In a chronic experiment, they compared food intake, wheel revolutions, and survival time between 6 rats that underwent electrical stimulation in the lateral hypothalamus (50% of maximal stimulation amplitude) and 8 rats that did not undergo stimulation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the acute experiment, overall electrical stimulation (25, 50, and 75% combined) and stimulation at 75% of the maximal stimulation amplitude significantly decreased the locomotor activity. However, if the authors omitted results of 1 rat, in which the electrode tip was not located in the lateral hypothalamus on one side but rather in the supraoptic chiasm, the remaining results did not yield significance. No other differences were observed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      When the findings of the current study are extrapolated to patients with anorexia nervosa, the authors do not expect major effects on symptoms with electrical stimulation at high frequency in the lateral hypothalamus."

Ghrelin has a unique post-translational modification: the hydroxyl group of the third amino acid, usually a serine but in some species a threonine, is esterified by octanoic acid and is essential for ghrelin's biological activities. The secretion of ghrelin increases under conditions of negative energy-balance, such as starvation, cachexia, and anorexia nervosa, whereas its expression decreases under conditions of positive energy-balance such as feeding, hyperglycemia, and obesity. In addition to having a powerful effect on the secretion of growth hormone, ghrelin stimulates food intake and transduces signals to hypothalamic regulatory nuclei that control energy homeostasis. Thus, it is interesting to note that the stomach may play an important role in not only digestion but also pituitary growth hormone release and central feeding regulation. We summarized recent findings on the integration of ghrelin into neuroendocrine networks that regulate food intake, energy balance, gastrointestinal function and growth."

Food-restriction (FR) stress evokes foraging, which translates to increased wheel running exercise (EX) for caged rodents, a maladaptive behavior, since it does not improve food access and exacerbates weight loss. While almost all adolescent rodents increase EX following FR, some then become resilient by suppressing EX by the second-fourth FR day, which minimizes weight loss. We asked whether GABAergic plasticity in the hippocampus may underlie this gain in resilience. In vitro slice physiology revealed doubling of pyramidal neurons' GABA response in the dorsal hippocampus of food-restricted animals with wheel access (FR + EX for 4 days), but without increase of mIPSC amplitudes. mIPSC frequency increased by 46%, but electron microscopy revealed no increase in axosomatic GABAergic synapse number onto pyramidal cells and only a modest increase (26%) of GABAergic synapse lengths. These changes suggest increase of vesicular release probability and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors and unsilencing of GABAergic synapses. GABAergic synapse lengths correlated with individual's suppression of wheel running and weight loss. These analyses indicate that EX can have dual roles-exacerbate weight loss but also promote resilience to some by dampening hippocampal excitability."

Activation of the melanocortin (MC) system leads to hypophagia and increased energy expenditure in ad libitum fed rats. Therefore, activation of the MC system might underlie the development and propagation of ABA. Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression is normally decreased during negative energy balance. Strikingly, we found a transient up-regulation of POMC mRNA levels in the arcuate nucleus during the development of ABA, indicating a hyperactive MC system. However, wheel running and food intake were not influenced by treating ABA rats with the competitive antagonist SHU9119. This suggests that agonism of MC receptors by endogenous alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) levels does not underlie ABA. Instead, treatment with the inverse agonist AgRP(83-132) did ameliorate signs of ABA. This implies that modulation of constitutive MC receptor activity rather than antagonizing putative alpha-MSH release contributes to the development and propagation of ABA."

Until more recently the role of most of the appetite modulators in the control of eating behavior was conceptualized solely in terms of their influence on homeostatic control of energy balance. However, it is becoming more and more evident that appetite modulators also affect the non-homeostatic cognitive, emotional and rewarding component of food intake as well as non food-related reward, and, recently, AN and BN have been pathophysiologically linked to dysfunctions of reward mechanisms. Therefore, the possibility exists that observed changes in appetite modulators in acute AN and BN may represent not only homeostatic adaptations to malnutrition, but also contribute to the development and/or the maintenance of aberrant non-homeostatic behaviors, such as self-starvation and binge eating. In the present review, the evidences supporting a role of leptin, ghrelin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and endocannabinoids in the homeostatic and non-homeostatic dysregulations of patients with AN and BN will be presented. The reviewed literature is highly suggestive that changes in the physiology of these modulators may play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of eating disorders by providing a possible link between motivated behaviors, reward processes, cognitive functions and energy balance."

Esrra-null female mice display a reduced operant response to a high-fat diet, compulsivity/behavioral rigidity, and social deficits. Selective Esrra knockdown in the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices of adult female mice recapitulates reduced operant response and increased compulsivity, respectively. These results indicate that Esrra deficiency in the mouse brain impairs behavioral responses in multiple functional domains."

This review highlights the latest mechanism by which ghrelin modulates body growth, appetite and energy metabolism by exploring pharmacological actions of the hormone and consequences of genetic or pharmacological blockade of the ghrelin/GHS-R (Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor) system on physiological responses in specific nutritional situations. Within the hypothalamus, novel mechanisms of action of this hormone involve its interaction with other ghrelin-derived peptides, such as desacyl ghrelin and obestatin, which are thought to act as functional ghrelin antagonists, and possible modulation of the GHS-R with other G-protein coupled receptors. During chronic undernutrition such as anorexia nervosa, variations of ghrelin-derived peptides may be an adaptative metabolic response to maintain normal glycemic control. Interestingly, some of ghrelin's metabolic actions are thought to be relayed through modulation of GH, an anabolic and hyperglycemic agent."
"['Perez-Leighton CE', 'Grace M', 'Billington CJ', 'Kotz CM.']",Role of spontaneous physical activity in prediction of susceptibility to activity based anorexia in male and female rats.,Physiol Behav,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic eating disorder affecting females and males, defined by body weight loss, higher physical activity levels and restricted food intake. Currently, the commonalities and differences between genders in etiology of AN are not well understood. Animal models of AN, such as activity-based anorexia (ABA), can be helpful in identifying factors determining individual susceptibility to AN. In ABA, rodents are given an access to a running wheel while food restricted, resulting in paradoxical increased physical activity levels and weight loss. Recent studies suggest that different behavioral traits, including voluntary exercise, can predict individual weight loss in ABA. A higher inherent drive for movement may promote development and severity of AN, but this hypothesis remains untested. In rodents and humans, drive for movement is defined as spontaneous physical activity (SPA), which is time spent in low-intensity, non-volitional movements. In this paper, we show that a profile of body weight history and behavioral traits, including SPA, can predict individual weight loss caused by ABA in male and female rats with high accuracy. Analysis of the influence of SPA on ABA susceptibility in males and females rats suggests that either high or low levels of SPA increase the probability of high weight loss in ABA, but with larger effects in males compared to females. These results suggest that the same behavioral profile can identify individuals at-risk of AN for both male and female populations and that SPA has predictive value for susceptibility to AN."

      Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) suffer from neuropsychological deficits including memory impairments. Memory partially depends on 17β-oestradiol (E2), which is reduced in patients with AN. We assessed whether memory functions correlate with E2 plasma levels in the activity-based anorexia (ABA) rat model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Nine 4-week-old female Wistar rats were sacrificed directly after weight loss of 20-25% (acute starvation), whereas 17 animals had additional 2-week weight-holding (chronic starvation). E2 serum levels and novel object recognition tasks were tested before and after starvation and compared with 21 normally fed controls.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Starvation disrupted menstrual cycle and impaired memory function, which became statistically significant in the chronic state (oestrous cycle (P < 0.001), E2 levels (P = 0.011) and object recognition memory (P = 0.042) compared to controls). E2 reduction also correlated with the loss of memory in the chronic condition (r = 0.633, P = 0.020).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results demonstrate that starvation reduces the E2 levels which are associated with memory deficits in ABA rats. These effects might explain reduced memory capacity in patients with AN as a consequence of E2 deficiency and the potentially limited effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions in the starved state. Future studies should examine whether E2 substitution could prevent cognitive deficits and aid in earlier readiness for therapy."

In a first experiment, we evaluated the effect of electrical stimulation or a curative lesion in the MD on survival, body weight, food intake and locomotor activity in ABA rats. Electrical MD stimulation or an electrolytic MD lesion did not improve the symptoms of rats in the ABA model, compared to control groups. In a second experiment, we investigated the effect of a preventive electrolytic lesion in the MD on rats in the ABA model. Although there was no significant improvement of survival, body weight and food intake, locomotor activity was significantly reduced in the lesion group compared to the control group.

Women show a marked gender-related sensitivity to disadaptive disorders. In addition to the well-studied role of sex steroids in modulating mood and behavior, a putative involvement of neurosteroid fluctuations, and in particular of allopregnanolone, has recently been hypothesized. In fact, several paraphysiological events and various disadaptive disorders in women are associated with modifications of circulating levels of this neurosteroid that might associated with a certain vulnerability to an altered adaptation to stressful life events."

To identify new genes involved in feeding behavior and body weight regulation we performed an expression profiling in the hypothalamus of the anx/anx mice. Using commercial microarrays we detected 156 differentially expressed genes and validated 92 of those using TaqMan low-density arrays. The expression of a set of 87 candidate genes selected based on literature evidences was also quantified by TaqMan low-density arrays. Our results showed enrichment in deregulated genes involved in cell death, cell morphology, and cancer, as well as an alteration of several signaling circuits involved in energy balance including neuropeptide Y and melanocortin signaling. The expression profile along with the phenotype led us to conclude that anx/anx mice resemble the anorexia-cachexia syndrome typically observed in cancer, infection with human immunodeficiency virus or chronic diseases, rather than starvation, and that anx/anx mice could be considered a good model for the treatment and investigation of this condition."
"['Giustina A', 'Mazziotti G', 'Canalis E.']","Growth hormone, insulin-like growth factors, and the skeleton.",Endocr Rev,"GH and IGF-I are important regulators of bone homeostasis and are central to the achievement of normal longitudinal bone growth and bone mass. Although GH may act directly on skeletal cells, most of its effects are mediated by IGF-I, which is present in the systemic circulation and is synthesized by peripheral tissues. The availability of IGF-I is regulated by IGF binding proteins. IGF-I enhances the differentiated function of the osteoblast and bone formation. Adult GH deficiency causes low bone turnover osteoporosis with high risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, and the low bone mass can be partially reversed by GH replacement. Acromegaly is characterized by high bone turnover, which can lead to bone loss and vertebral fractures, particularly in patients with coexistent hypogonadism. GH and IGF-I secretion are decreased in aging individuals, and abnormalities in the GH/IGF-I axis play a role in the pathogenesis of the osteoporosis of anorexia nervosa and after glucocorticoid exposure."
"['Sapolsky RM', 'Plotsky PM.']",Hypercortisolism and its possible neural bases.,Biol Psychiatry,"As is clear from the pages of this journal, biological psychiatrists remain fascinated by the phenomenon of dexamethasone (DEX) resistance and the hypercortisolism of various neuropsychiatric disorders. The mere existence of the endocrine abnormalities attests to the biological reality of these disorders. Furthermore, progress continues in using the occurrence of these endocrine defects as both diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease subtypes. Progress has also been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the endocrine defects. The adrenocortical axis is vastly complex, involving multiple hypothalamic-releasing factors under CNS control, shifting pituitary and adrenal sensitivies to hormonal signals, and feedback regulation at all three levels. What defects within this system produce DEX resistance and hypercortisolism? In this paper, we review data suggesting that the endocrine problems is, at least in part, neural in nature. Drawing upon a rodent literature, we will also suggest some models by which this can occur. The hypercortisolism found in cases of affective disorders, anorexia nervosa, Alzheimer's disease, among the very aged or the chronically stressed, is not a uniform phenomenon. Basal cortisol concentrations can be elevated in all or part of the circadian cycle. Resistance to glucocorticoid (GC) feedback inhibition (as typically demonstrated by DEX resistance) can occur; the resistance can be complete, or occur as early escape from DEX suppression. Finally, elevated basal cortisol concentrations and DEX resistance can occur independently of each other. Until the end of this review, we will conveniently refer to these variants of adrenocortical hyperactivity as ""hypercortisolism."" In addition, rather than using the term ""hypercortisolism"" for the rat, we will use ""hyperadrenocorticism"" (as they secrete corticosterone, rather than cortisol)."
"['Casper RC', 'Sullivan EL', 'Tecott L.']",Relevance of animal models to human eating disorders and obesity.,Psychopharmacology (Berl),"Background and rationale:
        
      
      This review addresses the role animal models play in contributing to our knowledge about the eating disorders anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) and obesity.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      Explore the usefulness of animal models in complex biobehavioral familial conditions, such as AN, BN, and obesity, that involve interactions among genetic, physiologic, psychological, and cultural factors.
    


          Results and conclusions:
        
      
      The most promising animal model to mimic AN is the activity-based anorexia rodent model leading to pathological weight loss. The paradigm incorporates reward elements of the drive for activity in the presence of an appetite and allows the use of genetically modified animals. For BN, the sham-feeding preparation in rodents equipped with a gastric fistula appears to be best suited to reproduce the postprandial emesis and the defects in satiety. Animal models that incorporate genes linked to behavior and mood may clarify biobehavioral processes underlying AN and BN. By contrast, a relative abundance of animal models has contributed to our understanding of human obesity. Both environmental and genetic determinants of obesity have been modeled in rodents. Here, we consider single gene mutant obesity models, along with models of obesigenic environmental conditions. The contributions of animal models to obesity research are illustrated by their utility for identifying genes linked to human obesity, for elucidating the pathways that regulate body weight and for the identification of potential therapeutic targets. The utility of these models may be further improved by exploring the impact of experimental manipulations on the behavioral determinants of energy balance."

Therefore, the way an individual copes with stress may affect AN vulnerability. Since prenatal stress (PNS) exposure alters stress responsivity in offspring this may increase their risk of developing AN. We tested this hypothesis using the activity based anorexia (ABA) rat model in control and PNS rats that were characterized by either proactive or passive stress-coping behavior. We found that PNS passively coping rats ate less and lost more weight during the ABA paradigm. Exposure to ABA resulted in higher baseline corticosterone and lower insulin levels in all groups. However, leptin levels were only decreased in rats with a proactive stress-coping style. Similarly, ghrelin levels were increased only in proactively coping ABA rats. Neuropeptide Y (Npy) expression was increased and proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) expression was decreased in all rats exposed to ABA. In contrast, agouti-related peptide (Agrp) and orexin (Hctr) expression were increased in all but the PNS passively coping ABA rats. Furthermore, DNA methylation of the orexin gene was increased after ABA in proactive coping rats and not in passive coping rats. Overall our study suggests that passive PNS rats have innate impairments in leptin and ghrelin in responses to starvation combined with prenatal stress associated impairments in Agrp and orexin expression in response to starvation. These impairments may underlie decreased food intake and associated heightened body weight loss during ABA in the passively coping PNS rats."

The age incidence of these conditions, the marked female excess, increase with economic and technological advance, precipitation by infection, and the paucity of histological changes are all consistent with the hypothesis. It can be tested directly using human sera to search for cross reaction with brain proteins in model systems such as Drosophila melanogaster. The conditions might be amenable to treatment using pooled immunoglobulin. Identification and elimination from the microbial flora of the bacteria that express the cross reacting antigens should be possible."
"['Camanni F', 'Ghigo E', 'Arvat E.']",Growth hormone-releasing peptides and their analogs.,Front Neuroendocrinol,"Growth hormone-releasing peptides (GHRPs) are a series of hepta (GHRP-1)- and hexapeptides (GHRP-2, GHRP-6, Hexarelin) that have been shown to be effective releasers of GH in animals and humans. More recently, a series of nonpeptidyl GH secretagogues (L-692,429, L-692,585, MK-0677) were discovered using GHRP-6 as a template. Some cyclic peptides as well as penta-, tetra-, and pseudotripeptides have also been described. This review summarizes recent developments in our understanding of the GHRPs, as well as the current nonpeptide pharmacologic analogs. GHRPs and their analogs have no structural homology with GHRH and act via specific receptors present at either the pituitary or the hypothalamic level. The GHRP receptor has recently been cloned and it does not show sequence homology with other G-protein-coupled receptors known so far. This evidence strongly suggests the existence of a natural GHRP-like ligand which, however, has not yet been found. Although the exact mechanism of action of GHRPs has not been fully established, there is probably a dual site of action on both the pituitary and the hypothalamus, possibly involving regulatory factors in addition to GHRH and somatostatin. Moreover, the possibility that GHRPs act via an unknown hypothalamic factor (U factor) is still open. The marked GH-releasing activity of GHRPs is reproducible and dose-related after intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, and even oral administration. The GH-releasing effect of GHRPs is the same in both sexes, but undergoes age-related variations. It increases from birth to puberty and decreases in aging. The GH-releasing activity of GHRPs is synergistic with that of GHRH and not affected by opioid receptor antagonists, while it is only blunted by inhibitory influences that are known to nearly abolish the effect of GHRH, such as neurotransmitters, glucose, free fatty acids, glucocorticoids, rhGH, and even exogenous somatostatin. GHRPs maintain their GH-releasing effect in somatotrope hypersecretory states, such as acromegaly, anorexia nervosa, and hyperthyroidism. On the other hand, GHRPs and their analogs have been reported to be effective in idiopathic short stature, in some situations of GH deficiency, in obesity, and in hypothyroidism, while in patients with pituitary stalk disconnection and in Cushing's syndrome the somatotrope responsiveness to GHRPs is almost absent. A potential role in the treatment of short stature, aging, catabolic states, and dilated cardiomyopathy has been envisaged."
"['Chowdhury TG', 'Wable GS', 'Sabaliauskas NA', 'Aoki C.']",Adolescent female C57BL/6 mice with vulnerability to activity-based anorexia exhibit weak inhibitory input onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.,Neuroscience,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder characterized by self-imposed severe starvation and often linked with excessive exercise. Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is an animal model that reproduces some of the behavioral phenotypes of AN, including the paradoxical increase in voluntary exercise following food restriction (FR). Although certain rodents have been used successfully in this animal model, C57BL/6 mice are reported to be less susceptible to ABA. We re-examined the possibility that female C57BL/6 mice might exhibit ABA vulnerability during adolescence, the developmental stage/sex among the human population with particularly high AN vulnerability. After introducing the running wheel to the cage for 3 days, ABA was induced by restricting food access to 1h per day (ABA1, N=13) or 2 h per day (ABA2, N=10). All 23 exhibited increased voluntary wheel running (p<0.005) and perturbed circadian rhythm within 2 days. Only one out of five survived ABA1 for 3 days, while 10 out of 10 survived ABA2 for 3 days and could subsequently restore their body weight and circadian rhythm. Exposure of recovered animals to a second ABA2 induction revealed a large range of vulnerability, even within littermates. To look for the cellular substrate of differences in vulnerability, we began by examining synaptic patterns in the hippocampus, a brain region that regulates anxiety as well as plasticity throughout life. Quantitative EM analysis revealed that CA1 pyramidal cells of animals vulnerable to the second ABA2 exhibit less GABAergic innervation on cell bodies and dendrites, relative to the animals resilient to the second ABA (p<0.001) or controls (p<0.05). These findings reveal that C57BL/6J adolescent females can be used to capture brain changes underlying ABA vulnerability, and that GABAergic innervation of hippocampal pyramidal neurons is one important cellular substrate to consider for understanding the progression of and resilience to AN."

Human and animal data supporting this hypothesis are reviewed, and important problems with the data base and the interpretation of these data are discussed.

['Van Vugt DA.'],Brain imaging studies of appetite in the context of obesity and the menstrual cycle.,Hum Reprod Update,"BACKGROUND Obesity affects many aspects of health, including reproduction. Despite unrelenting warnings about the health consequences of obesity, its prevalence continues to rise. Beginning with the discovery of leptin in 1994, the endocrinology of energy homeostasis has been significantly advanced. More recently, brain imaging studies have been providing novel insights into homeostatic and hedonic aspects of human ingestive behavior. METHODS A comprehensive MEDLINE search was conducted on the topic of neuroendocrine control of ingestive behavior with an emphasis on functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Additional articles were collected by hand searching the bibliographies of all relevant articles retrieved. RESULTS This review describes recent advances in our understanding of endocrine signals that respond to acute and chronic energy states and regulate ingestive behavior so as to achieve a balance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Recently published brain imaging studies, describing the neural networks that process endocrine signals of energy state and hedonic cues associated with highly palatable foods, are highlighted. Brain responses to food cues are described in the context of appetite changes during the menstrual cycle both in normal physiology and under the conditions anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of obesity belies the plethora of endocrine signals in place to ensure energy homeostasis. However, satiety signals appear to be counteracted by hedonic signals derived from highly palatable foods typical of today's diet. A better understanding of the interaction between homeostatic and hedonic signals is needed to devise effective strategies for dealing with obesity. Menstrual cycle dependent changes in brain responses to food cues may provide insight into the normal physiological control of ingestive behavior as well as dysfunctional regulation associated with disordered eating."

      To review the eating disorder research investigating the psychobiological connections between self-starvation and high-level exercising, including both animal experimentation and clinical field studies. In recent years it has been proposed that physical activity plays a central role in the pathogenesis and progression of the eating disorders-in particular, anorexia nervosa.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A review of research from animal experimentation and from clinical field studies investigating the biological and psychological implications of physical activity and starvation in the pathogenesis of eating disorders.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Animal research indicates that physical activity and starvation seem to potentiate one another and that alterations in the serotonergic system may underlie this process. Similar behavioural results have been found in recent clinical studies with eating-disordered patients, which suggests that physical activity plays a more central role in the development and maintenance of the eating disorders than had previously been thought.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The emerging picture is that psychosocial factors seem to provide the most compelling factors in the etiology and onset of the disorder, while biological factors-in most cases induced by severe malnutrition and strenuous overexercising-predominate in the maintenance of the disorder."
"['Griffin ML', 'South SA', 'Yankov VI', 'Booth RA Jr', 'Asplin CM', 'Veldhuis JD', 'Evans WS.']",Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and menstrual dysfunction.,Ann Med,"Disordered reproductive function has long been recognized as a prevalent problem among women of reproductive age who suffer from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Delay in menarchial age is frequently seen if IDDM develops in the peripubertal years and some form of menstrual dysfunction is found in nearly one-third of all women of reproductive age with IDDM. This review summarizes some of the prevailing views regarding the mechanisms through which uncontrolled IDDM is thought to disrupt normal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal function. Although animal studies have suggested that poorly controlled IDDM may adversely affect the uterovaginal outflow tract and/or ovarian function, no clinical studies have suggested that abnormal uterine or ovarian function underlies the menstrual dysfunction observed in young diabetic women. Similarly, pituitary function as assessed by basal gonadotrophins and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated gonadotrophin release appears to be normal in young women with IDDM. Moreover, although there has been some suggestion that pituitary function may decline with increasing duration of diabetes, this issue has not been thoroughly investigated. It appears that the oligo/amenorrhea noted in IDDM is principally hypothalamic in origin and may represent intermittent (and perhaps reversible) failure of the GnRH pulse generator, similar to the situation observed in women who engage in endurance training or who suffer from anorexia nervosa. Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms that subserve dysfunction of the GnRH neuronal system are not well understood, attention has focused on increased central opioidergic activity, increased central dopaminergic activity, and central glucose deprivation. In this era of emphasis on tight glycaemic control and its impact in preventing diabetes complications, the consequences of IDDM on reproductive potential appear to be important and must be included in future investigative efforts."
"['Small CJ', 'Stanley SA', 'Bloom SR.']",Appetite control and reproduction: leptin and beyond.,Semin Reprod Med,"It is now recognized that appropriate regulation of reproduction, energy intake, and energy expenditure, and thus maintenance of body weight and fertility, relies on complex hypothalamic neurocircuitry. Feeding and reproductive function are closely linked. During times of undernourishment and falling body fat the reproductive axis is down-regulated. Circulating factors and hypothalamic circuits coordinate these responses. Leptin has been described to be an important peripheral signal that indicates body fat stores to the hypothalamus and thus links nutrition and reproduction. Leptin acts by altering neuropeptide circuits in the hypothalamus, which alter gonadotropin-releasing hormone release and food intake. The importance of key neuropeptide systems identified in rodents is now being established in man. Notably mutations in the melanocortin MC4 receptor are found in up to 4% of the morbidly obese, and in a proportion of patients with anorexia nervosa mutations have been identified in the agouti-related peptide gene (AgRP), which codes for an endogenous antagonist of this receptor. Intranasal administration of a melanocortin fragment known to activate the MC4 receptor decreases adiposity in humans. The melanocortin system has been shown to influence the reproductive axis in rodents. However, the role of the melanocortin system in the control of reproduction in humans remains to be established. Since the discovery of leptin, attention has also been focused on peripheral signals that regulate reproduction, food intake, and energy expenditure, either directly or via feedback on hypothalamic circuits. Notable new discoveries in this area include the gastric hormone ghrelin. Circulating ghrelin stimulates food intake in rodents and humans, although an influence on the reproductive axis is yet to be reported."

It is separated from the general circulation by the blood-brain barrier, has high energy consumption and a low energy storage capacity, uses only specific substrates, and it can record information from the peripheral organs and control them. Here we present a new paradigm for the regulation of energy supply within the organism. The brain gives priority to regulating its own adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration. In that postulate, the peripheral energy supply is only of secondary importance. The brain has two possibilities to ensure its energy supply: allocation or intake of nutrients. The term 'allocation' refers to the allocation of energy resources between the brain and the periphery. Neocortex and the limbic-hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) system control the allocation and intake. In order to keep the energy concentrations constant, the following mechanisms are available to the brain: (1) high and low-affinity ATP-sensitive potassium channels measure the ATP concentration in neurons of the neocortex and generate a 'glutamate command' signal. This signal affects the brain ATP concentration by locally (via astrocytes) stimulating glucose uptake across the blood-brain barrier and by systemically (via the LHPA system) inhibiting glucose uptake into the muscular and adipose tissue. (2) High-affinity mineralocorticoid and low-affinity glucocorticoid receptors determine the state of balance, i.e. the setpoint, of the LHPA system. This setpoint can permanently and pathologically be displaced by extreme stress situations (chronic metabolic and psychological stress, traumatization, etc.), by starvation, exercise, infectious diseases, hormones, drugs, substances of abuse, or chemicals disrupting the endocrine system. Disorders in the 'energy on demand' process or the LHPA-system can influence the allocation of energy and in so doing alter the body mass of the organism. In summary, the presented model includes a newly discovered 'principle of balance' of how pairs of high and low-affinity receptors can originate setpoints in biological systems. In this 'Selfish Brain Theory', the neocortex and limbic system play a central role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as anorexia nervosa and obesity."

At these times feeding competes with other, more important activities. One way to avoid conflicts between feeding and these other activities to lower the programmed weight or set-point for body fat. Experiments on mammalian hibernators and incubating birds provide evidence that set-points are indeed lowered. Failure to eat in these two examples depends on anorexia, loss of appetite. A review of other examples suggests that conceptualization in terms of lowered set-points provides a unified and testable way of understanding many naturally occurring instances of fasting in the animal kingdom. Finally, spontaneous animal anorexias are contrasted with attempts by people to lose weight."

Recently, adipobiology (adiposcience) as become a focus of numerous studies showing that the adipose tissue is the body's largest endocrine organ producing multiple signaling proteins, including NGF and BDNF, all these dubbed adipokines. On the basis of our and other authors' evidence that low NGF and/or BDNF levels are found in cardiometabolic diseases (atherosclerosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome), a hypothesis of a critical role of neuro-metabotrophic deficit in the pathogenesis of these diseases has been raised. Since NGF and BDNF also exerts various synaptotrophic effects involved in cognitive enhancement, this hypothesis might also be related to neuropsychiatric diseases such as dementia, depression, schizophrenia, autism, Rett syndrome, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa. Finally, NGF- and BDNF-based therapeutic approach, including ampakines, antidepressants, selective deacetylase inhibitors, statins, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists, and ""brain food"" and calorie restriction, is outlined."
"['Aoki C', 'Sherpa AD.']",Making of a Synapse: Recurrent Roles of Drebrin A at Excitatory Synapses Throughout Life.,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Mature excitatory synapses are composed of more than 1500 proteins postsynaptically and hundreds more that operate presynaptically. Among them, drebrin is an F-actin-binding protein that increases noticeably during juvenile synaptogenesis. Electron microscopic analysis reveals that drebrin is highly enriched specifically on the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses. Since dendritic spines are structures specialized for excitatory synaptic transmission, the function of drebrin was probed by analyzing the ultrastructural characteristics of dendritic spines of animals with genetic deletion of drebrin A (DAKO), the adult isoform of drebrin. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that these brains are surprisingly intact, in that axo-spinous synaptic junctions are well-formed and not significantly altered in number. This normal ultrastructure may be because drebrin E, the alternate embryonic isoform, compensates for the genetic deletion of drebrin A. However, DAKO results in the loss of homeostatic plasticity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). The NMDAR activation-dependent trafficking of the NR2A subunit-containing NMDARs from dendritic shafts into spine head cytoplasm is greatly diminished within brains of DAKO. Conversely, within brains of wild-type rodents, spines respond to NMDAR blockade with influx of F-actin, drebrin A, and NR2A subunits of NMDARs. These observations indicate that drebrin A facilitates the trafficking of NMDAR cargos in an F-actin-dependent manner to mediate homeostatic plasticity. Analysis of the brains of transgenic mice used as models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) reveals that the loss of drebrin from dendritic spines predates the emergence of synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggesting that this form of homeostatic plasticity contributes toward cognition. Two studies suggest that the nature of drebrin's interaction with NMDARs is dependent on the receptor's subunit composition. Drebrin A can be found co-clustering with NR2B-containing NMDARs at the plasma membrane, while NR2A-containing NMDARs co-traffic into the spine cytoplasm but do not co-cluster at the plasma membrane. Most recently, we encountered a physiological condition that supports this idea. When adolescent female rats are reared under a condition of restricted food access and ad libitum wheel access, they paradoxically become excessive runners, choosing to run, even during the limited hours of food availability. This behavioral pattern is termed activity-based anorexia (ABA) and has served as an animal model for anorexia nervosa. Those animals that exhibit the greatest ABA vulnerability, in that they lose the most amount of body weight and run with greatest exuberance to the point of risking their lives, exhibit the highest levels of NR2B-NMDARs and drebrin at the postsynaptic membrane of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Those animals that exhibit the greatest resilience to ABA, in that they run minimally under such condition, thereby losing minimal amount of weight, exhibit the highest level of NR2A-NMDARs in the spine cytoplasm and lowest levels of drebrin at the postsynaptic membrane. This pattern suggests that drebrin has dual roles: retention of NR2A-NMDARs in the reserve pool and trafficking of NR2B-NMDARs to the postsynaptic membrane, ultimately contributing to an individual's reactivity to stress. Altogether, these observations indicate that drebrin is a protein that is important for synaptic plasticity and deserves the attention of neuroscientists studying the neurobiological basis of cognition and stress reactivity."

As osteoblasts and adipocytes originate from a common progenitor, with an inverse relationship existing between osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis, bone marrow adiposity often negatively correlates with osteoblast number and bone mineral density. Bone adiposity can be affected by several physiological and pathophysiological factors, with abnormal, elevated marrow fat resulting in a pathological state. This review focuses on the regulation of bone adiposity by physiological factors, including aging, mechanical loading and growth factor expression, as well as the pathophysiological factors, including diseases such as anorexia nervosa and dyslipidemia, and pharmacological agents such as thiazolidinediones and statins. Although these factors regulate bone marrow adiposity via a plethora of different intracellular signaling pathways, these diverse pathways often converge on the modulation of the expression and/or activity of the pro-adipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ2, suggesting that any factor that affects PPAR-γ2 may have an impact on the fat content of bone."

However, ghrelin and GHS, acting on central and peripheral receptors, also exert other actions. These include influence on pituitary functions, orexigenic action, influence on exocrine and endocrine gastro-entero-pancreatic functions, cardiovascular and anti-proliferative effects. In particular, the effect of ghrelin in promoting food intake and modulating energy metabolism strongly suggested that ghrelin has a key role in managing the neuroendocrine and metabolic response to starvation and that could be involved in the pathogenesis and/or in the metabolic and neuro-hormonal alterations of obesity and eating disorders.

Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is considered an animal model of anorexia nervosa, and combines scheduled feeding with voluntary running wheel activity (RWA). We investigated the effect of d-fenfluramine (d-FEN) treatment on development and propagation of ABA. d-FEN is an appetite suppressant and acts on 5-HT(2C) receptors that are located on pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Since stimulation activation of the melanocortin system stimulates ABA, we hypothesized that d-FEN treatment enhances the development and propagation of ABA. Rats were exposed to the ABA model and chronically infused with d-FEN. Unexpectedly, d-FEN-treated ABA rats did not reduce food intake or increase wheel running as compared with vehicle-treated ABA rats. Furthermore d-FEN treatment did not affect body weight loss, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, or starvation-induced hypothermia in ABA rats. POMC mRNA levels in d-FEN-treated rats were not different from vehicle-treated rats after one week of exposure to the ABA paradigm. However, d-FEN-treated ABA rats showed hypodypsia and increased plasma osmolality and arginine-vasopressin expression levels in the hypothalamus. We conclude that d-FEN treatment does not enhance ABA under the experimental conditions of this study, but strongly reduces water intake in ABA rats."

NPY (50 microgram) also increased mean CRF and AVP levels (1 h, 1.4- and 4.2-fold; 4 h, 1.1- and 1.9-fold), increased pituitary-adrenal activity at 1 h, and caused ACTH hypersecretion at 4 h. When added to cultured ovine anterior pituitary cells, NPY neither increased basal ACTH release nor augmented CRF- or AVP-induced ACTH release. We conclude that: (a) activation of either the central noradrenergic or NPY pathways causes an acute and sustained stimulation of the ovine HPA axis; (b) such activation increases the AVP/CRF ratio, suggesting a dominant role for AVP in the ovine stress response; and (c) the central noradrenergic or NPY systems may cause sustained HPA activation by attenuating or disrupting the glucocorticoid negative feedback on those brain areas concerned with regulation of the HPA axis. The possible roles of the central noradrenergic and NPY systems in the etiology of the hypercortisolemia of endogenous depression and anorexia nervosa are discussed."

      Abnormal feeding has been linked to disruptions in brain dopaminergic activity and recent studies have assessed the role of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in eating disorders. This is the first study to quantify the soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (S-COMT) activity in erythrocytes from patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED) and the first study at all to evaluate the COMT on patients with BED.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Forty blood samples from patients with AN, BN and BED and healthy controls were drawn to evaluate S-COMT activity in erythrocytes by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Since several patients were being treated with fluoxetine 20 mg, they were included in a different group (BN MED and BED MED). Liver homogenates from rats were used to evaluate baseline S-COMT activity in the presence of fluoxetine by the same in vitro procedures and assays.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Erythrocyte S-COMT activity (pmol/mg prt/h) was significantly increased in patients with BN and BED (41.3 ± 6.8 and 41.4 ± 14, respectively) compared to control group (25.3 ± 9.7). In fluoxetine-treated patients with BN, S-COMT activity (15.9 ± 8.8) was decreased compared to the other BN group; however, in BED group, the difference between BED MED and BED was not observed. In patients with AN, no significant difference was found compared to controls.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Patients with BN and BED presented higher S-COMT activity in erythrocytes, which is in agreement with previous studies on the literature addressing the high-activity COMT allele, Val158, as risk factor for eating disorders. Although in fluoxetine-treated patients with BN the activity of S-COMT was similar to the controls, this is not explained by a direct interaction between fluoxetine and S-COMT as verified in in vitro assays."

The lack of compounds acting as melanocortin receptor antagonists was the reason why pharmacological studies had not recognized melanocortin receptors as important drug targets earlier. Blockade of brain melanocortin receptors results in increased food intake and body weight, whereas stimulation of the brain melanocortin system results in decreased food intake and activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by decreased body weight and food intake accompanied by changes in neuroendocrine systems such as strong activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Since agouti-related protein suppresses the activity of the melanocortin system, the AgRP gene was investigated as candidate gene in anorexia nervosa. One variant of the AgRP gene was associated with anorexia nervosa, thus putting forward melanocortin receptor blockade as putative pharmacotherapy. Investigating variations in candidate genes in disease populations appears to be a fruitful approach towards the identification of drug targets."

      This in situ study aimed to evaluate whether rinsing with a calcium-containing solution prior to an erosive attack reduces the softening of enamel.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A total of 240 bovine enamel samples with determined baseline surface microhardness (KHN) were allocated to 5 runs in which each of the 12 volunteers performed the following experiment: 4 enamel samples were inserted in a custom-made intraoral appliance and carried in the mouth (upper jaw) for 30 min before each volunteer either rinsed his mouth for 60 s with a fluoride- and stannous ion-containing dental erosion protection mouth rinse as positive control (run 1), milk (run 2), a solution prepared from a 500-mg calcium effervescent tablet dissolved in 100 mL (run 3) or 200 mL (run 4) water, or did not perform any rinsing with a test solution before the erosive attack (run 5, negative control). To simulate the erosive attack, volunteers rinsed their mouth with a commercial soft drink (Sprite Zero) for 60 s and afterwards with water to stop the erosive process. Finally, surface microhardness was measured again and hardness loss (ΔKHN) calculated. A mixed effect model was fitted to the data set to investigate whether the different runs showed differences with respect to ΔKHN.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No significant difference in softening of enamel (mean of ΔKHN; lower confidence level/upper confidence level) was observed between the negative control run 5 (50.7; 60.8/40.6), run 2 (50.7; 60.8/40.6), run 3 (38.7; 48.8/28.6) and run 4 (40.7; 50.8/30.6) (p > 0.05, respectively). Enamel softening in the positive control run 1 (25.4; 35.6/15.3) was significantly lower compared to the softening in run 5 (p < 0.001). No significant difference was observed between run 1 and run 3 (p = 0.09).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Other than the fluoride- and stannous ion-containing dental erosion protection mouth rinse, none of the investigated calcium-containing solutions is able to significantly reduce erosion-induced softening of enamel."

The unique post-translational modification of O-n-octanoylation at serine 3 is the first in peptide discovery history and is essential for GH-releasing ability. Des-acyl ghrelin, lacking O-n-octanoylation at serine 3, is also produced in the stomach and remains the major molecular form secreted into the circulation. The third ghrelin gene product, obestatin, a novel 23-amino acid peptide identified from rat stomach, was found by comparative genomic analysis. Three ghrelin gene products actively participate in modulating appetite, adipogenesis, gut motility, glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, immune, sleep, memory, anxiety, cognition, and stress. Knockdown or knockout of acyl ghrelin and/or GHS-R1a, and overexpression of des-acyl ghrelin show benefits in the therapy of obesity and metabolic syndrome. By contrast, agonism of acyl ghrelin and/or GHS-R1a could combat human anorexia-cachexia, including anorexia nervosa, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, burn, and postsurgery recovery, as well as restore gut dysmotility, such as diabetic or neurogenic gastroparesis, and postoperative ileus. The ghrelin acyl-modifying enzyme, ghrelin O-Acyltransferase (GOAT), which attaches octanoate to serine-3 of ghrelin, has been identified and characterized also from the stomach. To date, ghrelin is the only protein to be octanylated, and inhibition of GOAT may have effects only on the stomach and is unlikely to affect the synthesis of other proteins. GOAT may provide a critical molecular target in developing novel therapeutics for obesity and type 2 diabetes."

In ABA, scheduled feeding in combination with voluntary wheel running leads to hyperactivity, reduced food intake, severe body weight loss and hypothermia. In this study it was investigated whether hyperactivity in ABA could be reduced by introducing a warm plate (which was voluntary accessible and did not influence ambient temperature) into a part of the cage. In ad libitum fed rats, the presence of the warm plate did not influence body temperature, running wheel activity (RWA), body weight or food intake. During ABA, however, rats preferred the warm plate and hypothermia was prevented, while hyperactivity and body weight loss were significantly reduced when compared to ABA rats without a plate. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association between basal body temperature and RWA during the light phase in ABA rats. However, there was no evidence that initiation of light phase RWA was a result of hypothermia. These data suggest that ABA rats prefer to prevent hypothermia passively by choosing a warm plate rather than actively regulating body temperature by hyperactivity."

Two populations of neurons project from the striatum: direct pathway medium spiny neurons and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons. The selective contribution of direct pathway medium spiny neurons and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons to food-related actions and consumption remains unknown. Here, we used in vivo electrophysiology and fiber photometry in mice (of both sexes) to record both spiking activity and pathway-specific calcium activity of dorsal striatal neurons during approach to and consumption of food pellets. While electrophysiology revealed complex task-related dynamics across neurons, population calcium was enhanced during approach and inhibited during consumption in both pathways. We also observed ramping changes in activity that preceded both pellet-directed actions and spontaneous movements. These signals were heterogeneous in the spiking units, with neurons exhibiting either increasing or decreasing ramps. In contrast, the population calcium signals were homogeneous, with both pathways having increasing ramps of activity for several seconds before actions were initiated. An analysis comparing population firing rates to population calcium signals also revealed stronger ramping dynamics in the calcium signals than in the spiking data. In a second experiment, we trained the mice to perform an action sequence to evaluate when the ramping signals terminated. We found that the ramping signals terminated at the beginning of the action sequence, suggesting they may reflect upcoming actions and not preconsumption activity. Plasticity of such mechanisms may underlie disorders that alter action selection, such as drug addiction or obesity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alterations in striatal function have been linked to pathological consumption in disorders, such as obesity and drug addiction. We recorded spiking and population calcium activity from the dorsal striatum during ad libitum feeding and an operant task that resulted in mice obtaining food pellets. Dorsal striatal neurons exhibited long ramps in activity that preceded actions by several seconds, and may reflect upcoming actions. Understanding how the striatum controls the preparation and generation of actions may lead to improved therapies for disorders, such as drug addiction or obesity."

As noted also by several other groups we have found that anandamide, a major endocannabinoid, enhances appetite in mice. On partial or full food deprivation over 24 h the levels of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), a second major cannabinoid, are initially elevated in mouse brain; however, partial food deprivation over a longer period causes reduction of 2-AG levels. Blocking the endocannabinoid system with a CB1 antagonist on the 1st day after birth leads to inhibition of suckling; later administration also affects suckling, but does not fully block it."

The onset of AN is most often at puberty, suggesting that gonadal hormonal fluctuations may contribute to AN vulnerability. Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is an animal model that reproduces some of the behavioral phenotypes of AN, including the paradoxical increase in voluntary exercise following food restriction. The basal amygdala as well as the GABAergic system regulate trait anxiety. We therefore examined the subcellular distribution of GABA receptors (GABARs) in the basal amygdala of female pubertal rats and specifically of their α4 subunits, because expression of α4-containing GABARs is regulated by gonadal hormone fluctuations. Moreover, because these GABARs reduce neuronal excitability through shunting of EPSPs, we quantified the frequency of occurrence of these GABARs adjacent to excitatory synapses. Electron microscopic immunoctychemistry revealed no change in the frequency of association of α4 subunits with excitatory synapses on dendritic spines, whether in the anterior (Bregma -2.8 mm) or caudal (Bregma -3.8 mm) portion of the basal amygdala. Sholl analysis of golgi-stained neurons also revealed no change in the extent of dendritic branching by these densely spiny, pyramidal-like neurons. However, there was an increase of membranous α4 subunits near excitatory synapses on dendritic shafts, specifically in the caudal basal amygdala, and this was accompanied by a rise of α4 subunits intracellularly. Because most dendritic shafts exhibiting excitatory synapses are GABAergic interneurons, the results predict disinhibition, which would increase excitability of the amygdaloid network, in turn augmenting ABA animals' anxiety."

Among the bottlenecks limiting the introduction of new medicines is the reported heterogeneity of these diseases, which makes it difficult to find drugs with broad activity and the lack of animal models with translational validity, especially in the case of anorexia nervosa. Some kinds of obesity and eating disorders can be classified within the pathologies affecting the brain reward system together with drug addiction and others, and therefore specific treatments in these cases can be directed to restore normal function in brain reward pathways. Target identification in this field can greatly benefit from the combined application of genomic/proteomic techniques and robust animal models of reward deficits."

Unfortunately, this critical process is affected in a high number of mentally ill patients. Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa are prevalent in modern societies. Impaired appetite and weight loss are common in patients with depression. In addition, the use of neuroleptics frequently produces obesity and diabetes mellitus. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of these behavioral and metabolic conditions are largely unknown. In this review, we first concentrate on the established brain machinery of food intake and body weight, especially on the melanocortin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) systems as illustration. These systems play a critical role in receiving and processing critical peripheral metabolic cues such as leptin and ghrelin. It is also notable that both systems modulate emotion and motivated behavior as well. Secondly, we discuss the significance and potential promise of multidisciplinary molecular and neuroanatomic techniques that will likely increase the understanding of brain circuitries coordinating energy homeostasis and emotion. Finally, we introduce several lines of evidence suggesting a link between the melanocortin/NPY systems and several neurotransmitter systems on which many of the psychotropic agents exert their influence."

      The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on obstetric factors at birth and their role as risk factors for a subsequent eating disorder (ED) and where possible to perform a meta-analysis of case-control studies of EDs and obstetric complications (OCs).
    


          Method:
        
      
      Studies were ascertained by computer searches of electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL), searches of reference lists and from raw data obtained upon request from the authors. A total of 14 studies were identified for the systematic review, of which 6 were eligible for the subsequent meta-analysis. Of the selected 6 studies, 5 reported on the same OCs, namely vaginal instrumental delivery and prematurity. Accordingly, meta-analyses were run on these two variables. Both analyses were conducted on anorexia nervosa (AN) patients.

      Binge eating (BE) involves the consumption of a large amount of food in a short period of time and a loss of control during the binge episode. It is a key feature of the major subtypes of eating disorders like bulimia nervosa, BE disorder, anorexia nervosa binge/purge type. Alterations in the mesocorticolimbic pathway play a crucial role in its pathophysiology.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      We hypothesized that BE rats receiving deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the prelimbic cortex, a functional analog of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in humans, would have a reduced binge size compared with those receiving sham stimulation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a DBS electrode in the left prelimbic cortex. A protocol which included limited access to a ""sweet-fat"" diet was used to achieve a chronic BE state in the rats. After reaching a stable binge size, each rat had undergone sham, low-frequency stimulation (60 Hz), and high-frequency (130 Hz) stimulation for 3 sessions each, and 2 consecutive treatments were separated by at least 2 empty sessions to allow a washout of the effects. A one-way ANOVA was used for the data analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Low-frequency (60 Hz) stimulation of the prelimbic cortex significantly reduced the binge size compared to the sham stimulation (p < 0.0001). High-frequency DBS (130 Hz) had no significant influence on this behavior when compared to sham stimulation (p = 0.9).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study suggests that low-frequency prelimbic cortex stimulation in BE would be useful for correcting prefrontal hypofunction which is strongly associated with BE and addiction pathogenesis."

A high proportion of well-trained dancers and athletes also have amenorrhoea, though weight may be in the normal range, since muscles are heavy (80% water, compared to 5-10% water in adipose tissue). The amenorrhoea is usually reversible with weight gain, decreased exercise or both. The amenorrhoea is due to hypothalamic dysfunction; the pituitary-ovary axis is intact, suggesting that this type of amenorrhoea is adaptive, preventing an unsuccessful pregnancy outcome. Evidence is presented that the high percentage of body fat (26-28%) in mature women is necessary for regular ovulatory cycles. Target weights for height are given for the evaluation and treatment of primary and secondary amenorrhoea due to weight loss. The high percentage of body fat in women may influence reproductive ability directly: (1) as an extragonadal source of oestrogen by aromatization of androgen to oestrogen; (2) by influencing the direction of oestrogen metabolism to more potent or less potent forms; or (3) by changes in the binding properties of sex-hormone-binding globulin. Indirect signals may be of abnormal control of temperature and changes in energy metabolism, which accompany excessive leanness."

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating neural survival, development, function, and plasticity in the brain. Recent findings using heterozygous BDNF (+/-) knock-out (reduced BDNF levels) mice have provided evidence that BDNF plays a role in regulating eating behaviors. Recently, we found that serum levels of BDNF in patients with eating disorders are significantly decreased compared with normal controls. In addition, an association between the BDNF gene polymorphism and eating disorders has been demonstrated. We reviewed the role of BDNF in the pathophysiology of eating disorders and the BDNF gene as a susceptibility gene for eating disorders. Considering the low levels of BDNF in patients with eating disorders, using drugs that increase the BDNF levels and/or BDNF gene therapy are possible novel therapeutic approaches. Providing confirmation that the BDNF gene is the true susceptibility gene for eating disorders could lead to rapid therapeutic progress in treating these disorders. In addition, a more complete understanding of the signal transduction pathway via the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and TrkB receptors would provide new perspectives for treating eating disorders."
"['Hassouna R', 'Zizzari P', 'Tolle V.']","The ghrelin/obestatin balance in the physiological and pathological control of growth hormone secretion, body composition and food intake.",J Neuroendocrinol,"Ghrelin and obestatin are two gastrointestinal peptides obtained by post-translational processing of a common precursor, preproghrelin. Ghrelin is an orexigenic and adipogenic peptide and a potent growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) modified by the enzyme ghrelin-O-acyl-transferase to bind and activate its receptor, the GHS-R. The ghrelin/GHS-R pathway is complex and the effects of ghrelin on GH secretion, adiposity and food intake appear to be relayed by distinct mechanisms involving different transduction signals and constitutive activity for the GH-R, different cofactors as modulators of endogenous ghrelin signalling and/or alternative ghrelin receptors. The discovery of obestatin in 2005 brought an additional level of complexity to this fascinating system. Obestatin was initially identified as an anorexigenic peptide and as the cognate ligand for GPR39, but its effect on food intake and its ability to activate GPR39 are still controversial. Although several teams failed to reproduce the anorexigenic actions of obestatin, this peptide has been shown to antagonise GH secretion and food intake induced by ghrelin and could be an interesting pharmacological tool to counteract the actions of ghrelin. Ghrelin and obestatin immunoreactivities are recovered in the blood with an ultradian pulsatility and their concentrations in plasma vary with the nutritional status of the body. It is still a matter of debate whether both hormones are regulated by independent mechanisms and whether obestatin is a physiologically relevant peptide. Nevertheless, a significant number of studies show that the ghrelin/obestatin ratio is modified in anorexia nervosa and obesity. This suggests that the ghrelin/obestatin balance could be essential to adapt the body's response to nutritional challenges. Although measuring ghrelin and obestatin in plasma is challenging because many forms of the peptides circulate, more sensitive and selective assays to detect the different preproghrelin-derived peptides are being developed and may be the key to obtaining a better understanding of their roles in different physiological and pathological conditions."

In the second family, analysis of eight members across four generations identified a missense mutation in the histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) gene that segregated with illness. ESRRA and HDAC4 were determined to interact both in vitro in HeLa cells and in vivo in mouse cortex. Transcriptional analysis revealed that HDAC4 potently represses the expression of known ESRRA-induced target genes. Biochemical analysis of candidate mutations revealed that the identified ESRRA mutation decreased its transcriptional activity, while the HDAC4 mutation increased transcriptional repression of ESRRA. Our findings suggest that mutations that result in decreased ESRRA activity increase the risk of developing EDs."

We have previously shown inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hypothalamus of an animal model for anorexia, the anx/anx mouse. Moreover, increased incidence of eating disorders, e.g., anorexia nervosa, has been observed in diabetic individuals. In the present investigation we evaluated whether impaired mitochondrial phosphorylation and inflammation also occur in endocrine pancreas of anorectic mice, and if glucose homeostasis is disturbed. We show that anx/anx mice exhibit marked glucose intolerance associated with reduced insulin release following an intraperitoneal injection of glucose. In contrast, insulin release from isolated anx/anx islets is increased after stimulation with glucose or KCl. In isolated anx/anx islets there is a strong downregulation of the mitochondrial complex I (CI) assembly factor, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1α subcomplex, assembly factor 1 (Ndufaf1), and a reduced CI activity. In addition, we show elevated concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs) in anx/anx serum and increased macrophage infiltration (indicative of inflammation) in anx/anx islets. However, isolated islets from anx/anx mice cultured in the absence of FFAs do not exhibit increased inflammation. We conclude that the phenotype of the endocrine pancreas of the anx/anx mouse is characterized by increased levels of circulating FFAs, as well as inflammation, which can inhibit insulin secretion in vivo. The anx/anx mouse may represent a useful tool for studying molecular mechanisms underlying the association between diabetes and eating disorders."
"['Matarese G', 'Procaccini C', 'De Rosa V.']",The intricate interface between immune and metabolic regulation: a role for leptin in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis?,J Leukoc Biol,"Over the last few years, a series of molecules known to play a function in metabolism has also been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the immune response. In this context, the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin has been shown to regulate the immune response in normal as well as in pathological conditions. More specifically, it has been shown that conditions of reduced leptin production (i.e., genetic leptin deficiency, anorexia nervosa, malnutrition) are associated with increased susceptibility to infections. Conversely, immune-mediated disorders such as autoimmune disorders are associated with increased secretion of leptin and production of proinflammatory, pathogenic cytokines. Leptin could represent the ""missing link"" among immune response, metabolic function, and nutritional status. Indeed, more recently, leptin-deficient mice have been shown to be resistant to a series of experimentally induced autoimmune disorders including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Normal wild-type mice show increased secretion of leptin in serum upon EAE induction, and brain inflammatory infiltrates stain positive for leptin. Finally, leptin neutralization with leptin antagonists improves the EAE course by profoundly altering intracellular signaling of myelin-reactive T cells and increasing the number of regulatory forkhead/winged helix transcription factor 3(+)CD4(+) T cells. These data suggest that leptin can be considered as a link among immune tolerance, metabolic state, and autoimmunity and that strategies aimed at interfering with the leptin axis could represent innovative, therapeutic tools for autoimmune disorders."
"['Sweeney P', 'Yang Y.']",An Inhibitory Septum to Lateral Hypothalamus Circuit That Suppresses Feeding.,J Neurosci,"Feeding behavior is orchestrated by neural circuits primarily residing in the hypothalamus and hindbrain. However, the relative influence of cognitive and emotional brain circuits to the feeding circuitry in the hypothalamus and hindbrain remains unclear. Here, using the cell-type selectivity of genetic methods, circuit mapping, and behavior assays, we sought to decipher neural circuits emanating from the septal nucleus to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that contribute to neural regulation of food intake in mice. We found that chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of septal vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT)-containing neurons or their projections in the LH reduced food intake in mice. Consistently, chemogenetic inhibition of septal vGAT neurons increased food intake. Furthermore, we investigated a previously unknown neural circuit originating from septal vGAT neurons to a subset of vGAT neurons in the LH, an area involved in homeostatic and hedonic control of energy states. Collectively, our data reveal an inhibitory septohypothalamic feeding circuit that might serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa.
    


          Significance statement:
        
      
      Our results demonstrate that top-down projections from the septum to the hypothalamus control food intake negatively. Given the known role for both of these brain regions in the control of feeding and emotion-related behaviors, these findings reveal previously unknown neural circuitry that is likely implicated in emotional aspects of food intake and provide new insights into the development of therapeutic targets for the treatment of eating disorders."
"['Duclos M', 'Ouerdani A', 'Mormède P', 'Konsman JP.']",Food restriction-induced hyperactivity: addiction or adaptation to famine?,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Increased physical activity is present in 30-80% of anorexia nervosa patients. To explain the paradox of low food intake and excessive exercise in humans and other animals, it has been proposed that increased physical activity along with food restriction activates brain reward circuits and is addictive. Alternatively, the fleeing-famine hypothesis postulates that refusal of known scarce energy-low food sources and hyperactivity facilitate migration towards new habitats that potentially contain new energy-rich foodstuffs. The use of rewarding compounds that differ in energy density, such as the energy-free sweetener saccharin and the energy rich sucrose makes it possible to critically test the reward-addiction and fleeing-famine hypotheses. The aims of the present work were to study if sucrose and/or saccharin could attenuate food restriction-induced hyperactivity, weight loss, increased plasma corticosterone, and activation of brain structures involved in neuroendocrine control, energy balance, physical activity, and reward signaling in rats. Its major findings are that access to sucrose, but not to saccharin, attenuated food restriction-induced running wheel activity, weight loss, rises in plasma corticosterone, and expression of the cellular activation marker c-Fos in the paraventricular and arcuate hypothalamus and in the nucleus accumbens. These findings suggest that the energy-richness and easy availability of sucrose interrupted a fleeing-famine-like hyperactivity response. Since corticosterone mediates food restriction-induced wheel running (Duclos et al., 2009), we propose that the attenuating effect of sucrose consumption on plasma corticosterone plays a role in reduced wheel running and weight loss by lowering activation of the nucleus accumbens and arcuate hypothalamus in these animals."

The daily variation of biological variables arises from an internal time-keeping system. The major action of the environment is to synchronize the internal clock to a period of exactly 24 h. The light-dark cycle, food ingestion, barometric pressure, acoustic stimuli, scents and social cues have been mentioned as synchronizers or ""zeitgebers"". The circadian rhythmicity of plasma corticosteroids has been well characterized in man and in rats and evidence has been accumulated showing daily rhythmicity at every level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Studies of restricted feeding in rats are of considerable importance because they reveal feeding as a major synchronizer of rhythms in HPA axis activity. The daily variation of the HPA axis stress response appears to be closely related to food intake as well as to basal activity. In humans, the association of feeding and HPA axis activity has been studied under physiological and pathological conditions such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, malnutrition, obesity, diabetes mellitus and Cushing's syndrome. Complex neuroanatomical pathways and neurochemical circuitry are involved in feeding-associated HPA axis modulation. In the present review we focus on the interaction among HPA axis rhythmicity, food ingestion, and different nutritional and endocrine states."

Investigations into the biological basis of the multiple effects of cannabis have yielded important breakthroughs in recent years: the discovery of two cannabinoid receptors in brain and peripheral organ systems, and endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) for these receptors. These advances have greatly increased our understanding of how appetite is regulated through these endocannabinoid receptor systems. The presence of endocannabinoids in the developing brain and in maternal milk have led to evidence for a critical role for CB1 receptors in oral motor control of suckling during neonatal development. The endocannabinoids appear to regulate energy balance and food intake at four functional levels within the brain and periphery: (i) limbic system (for hedonic evaluation of foods), (ii) hypothalamus and hindbrain (integrative functions), (iii) intestinal system, and (iv) adipose tissue. At each of these levels, the endocannabinoid system interacts with a number of better known molecules involved in appetite and weight regulation, including leptin, ghrelin, and the melanocortins. Therapeutically, appetite stimulation by cannabinoids has been studied for several decades, particularly in relation to cachexia and malnutrition associated with cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or anorexia nervosa. The recent advances in cannabinoid pharmacology may lead to improved treatments for these conditions or, conversely, for combating excessive appetite and body weight, such as CB1 receptor antagonists as antiobesity medications. In conclusion, the exciting progress in the understanding of how the endocannabinoid CB receptor systems influence appetite and body weight is stimulating the development of therapeutic orexigenic and anorectic agents. Furthermore, the role of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation for milk suckling in newborns may open new doors toward understanding nonorganic failure-to-thrive in infants, who display growth failure without known organic cause."

In addition, obesity is also commonly linked to altered puberty onset and reproductive impairment. Such an impact of energy status on the reproductive axis is conveyed through a number of neuropeptide hormones and metabolic cues, whose nature and mechanisms of action have begun to be deciphered only in recent years. In this context, the emergence of kisspeptins, encoded by the KiSS-1 gene, and their receptor, GPR54, as indispensable signals for normal pubertal maturation and gonadal function, has raised the possibility that the KiSS-1/GRP54 system might also participate in coupling body energy status and reproduction. We revise herein the experimental evidence, gathered in rodent models, supporting the contention that the hypothalamic KiSS-1 system operates as a central conduit for conveying metabolic information onto the centers governing reproductive function, through a putative leptin-kisspeptin-GnRH pathway. Admittedly, key aspects of this 'metabolic' network involving the KiSS-1 system, such as its different peripheral regulators and central effectors, have not been fully elucidated. Nonetheless, the proposed hypothalamic circuitry, responsible for transmitting metabolic information onto the reproductive axis through KiSS-1 neurons, might explain, at least in part, the mechanisms for the well-known alterations of fertility linked to conditions of disturbed energy balance in humans, from anorexia nervosa to morbid obesity."
['Leibowitz SF.'],Neurochemical-neuroendocrine systems in the brain controlling macronutrient intake and metabolism.,Trends Neurosci,"Appetite, energy balance and body weight gain are modulated by diverse neurochemical and neuroendocrine signals from different organs in the body and diverse regions in the brain. The hypothalamus plays an important integrative function in this process, acting through a variety of systems that involve a close interaction between nutrients, amines, neuropeptides and hormones. These systems underlie normal nutrient intake and metabolism and are thought to be responsible for shifts in feeding behavior across the circadian cycle and fluctuations relating to gender and age in both rats and humans. Moreover, alterations in these normal neurochemical-neuroendocrine systems may be associated with abnormal eating patterns, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia and obesity. Understanding the systems that control eating behavior might provide a foundation for the treatment and possible prevention of such disorders."

These are the Papez or medial circuit, the basolateral circuit and the defence reaction circuit. The functions of the primitive limbic brain are modulated by a higher order control—the frontal lobe. Emotional responses and physiological changes have been obtained by stimulation of fronto-limbic pathways and limbic circuits and these have been used for location of target sites in psychosurgery. For the relief of intractable depression and anxiety, lesions are generally made in the lower medial quadrant or posteroorbital part of the frontal lobe, where there is a concentration of fronto-limbic connections. In primary obsessional neurosis lesions at this site produce less satisfactory results, but these illnesses may be helped by lesions in the cingulate gyrus, which is part of the Papez circuit. Patients with epilepsy and aggressive outbursts may respond to temporal lobotomy, or to operations, such as amygdalotomy, where lesions are placed in the defence reaction circuit."
"['Aoki C', 'Chen YW', 'Chowdhury TG', 'Piper W.']",alpha4betadelta-GABA(A) receptors in dorsal hippocampal CA1 of adolescent female rats traffic to the plasma membrane of dendritic spines following voluntary exercise and contribute to protection of animals from activity-based anorexia through localization at excitatory synapses.,J Neurosci Res,"In hippocampal CA1 of adolescent female rodents, α4βδ-GABAA receptors (α4βδ-GABAA Rs) suppress excitability of pyramidal neurons through shunting inhibition at excitatory synapses. This contributes to anxiolysis of stressed animals. Socially isolated adolescent female rats with 8 days of wheel access, the last 4 days of which entail restricted food access, have been shown to exhibit excessive exercise, choosing to run instead of eat (activity-based anorexia [ABA]). Upregulation of α4βδ-GABAA Rs in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 (DH), seen among some ABA animals, correlates with suppression of excessive exercise. We used electron microscopic immunocytochemistry to show that exercise alone (EX), but not food restriction alone (FR), also augments α4βδ-GABAA R expression at axospinous excitatory synapses of the DH (67%, P = 0.027), relative to socially isolated controls without exercise or food restriction (CON). Relative to CON, ABA animals' synaptic α4βδ-GABAA R elevation was modestly elevated (37%), but this level correlated strongly and negatively with individual differences in ABA vulnerability-i.e., food restriction-evoked hyperactivity (Pearson R = -0.902, P = 0.002) and weight changes (R = 0.822, P = 0.012). These correlations were absent from FR and EX brains or ventral hippocampus of ABA brains. Comparison to CON of α4βδ-GABAA R location in the DH indicated that ABA induces trafficking of α4βδ-GABAA R from reserve pools in spine cytoplasm to excitatory synapses. Pair-housing CON animals reduced cytoplasmic α4βδ-GABAA R without reducing synaptic α4βδ-GABAA R. Thus, exercise induces trafficking of α4βδ-GABAA Rs to excitatory synapses, while individual differences in ABA vulnerability are linked most strongly to trafficking of α4βδ-GABAA Rs in the reverse direction-from excitatory synapses to the reserve pool during co-occurring food restriction. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"['Fehm HL', 'Kern W', 'Peters A.']",The selfish brain: competition for energy resources.,Prog Brain Res,"Although the brain constitutes only 2% of the body mass, its metabolism accounts for 50% of total body glucose utilization. This delicate situation is aggravated by the fact that the brain depends on glucose as energy substrate. Thus, the contour of a major problem becomes evident: how can the brain maintain constant fluxes of large amounts of glucose to itself in the presence of powerful competitors as fat and muscle tissue. Activity of cortical neurons generates an ""energy on demand"" signal which eventually mediates the uptake of glucose from brain capillaries. Because energy stores in the circulation (equivalent to ca. 5 g glucose) are also limited, a second signal is required termed ""energy on request""; this signal is responsible for the activation of allocation processes. The term ""allocation"" refers to the activation of the ""behavior control column"" by an input from the hippocampus-amygdala system. As far as eating behavior is concerned the behavior control column consists of the ventral medial hypothalamus (VMH) and periventricular nucleus (PVN). The PVN represents the central nucleus of the brain's stress systems, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Activation of the sympatico-adrenal system inhibits glucose uptake by peripheral tissues by inhibiting insulin release and inducing insulin resistance and increases hepatic glucose production. With an inadequate ""energy on request"" signal neuroglucopenia would be the consequence. A decrease in brain glucose can activate glucose-sensitive neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) with the release of orexigenic peptides which stimulate food intake. If the energy supply of the brain depends on activation of the LH rather than on increased allocation to the brain, an increase in body weight is evitable. An increase in fat mass will generate feedback signals as leptin and insulin, which activate the arcuate nucleus. Activation of arcuate nucleus in turn will stimulate the activity of the PVN in a way similar to the activation by the hippocampus-amydala system. The activity of PVN is influenced by the hippocampal outflow which in turn is the consequence of a balance of low-affinity and high-affinity glucocorticoid receptors. This set-point can permanently be displaced by extreme stress situations, by starvation, exercise, hormones, drugs or by endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Disorders in the ""energy on request"" process will influence the allocation of energy and in so doing alter the body mass of the organism. In this ""selfish brain theory"" the neocortex and the limbic system play a central role in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as anorexia nervosa, obesity and diabetes mellitus type II. From these considerations it appears that the primary disturbance in obesity is a displacement of the hippocampal set-point of the system. The resulting permanent activation of the feedback system must result in a likewise permanent activation of the sympatico-adrenal system, which induces insulin resistance, hypertension and the other components of the metabolic syndrome. Available therapies for treatment of the metabolic syndrome (blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, insulin and insulin secretagogues) interfere with mechanisms, which must be considered compensatory. This explains why these therapies are disappointing in the long run. New therapeutic strategies based on the ""selfish brain theory"" will be discussed."

The hypothesis is based mainly on the following facts: (1) melatonin is well known to exert an inhibitory effect on gonadotropin secretion; (2) melatonin binding is increased in brains of fasted rats; (3) undernutrition dramatically increases the inhibitory effect of exogenous melatonin on gonadotropin-releasing hormone-induced gonadotropin secretion in female rats; (4) the administration of propranolol in girls suffering from anorexia nervosa diminishes the nocturnal peak of melatonin and, in parallel, restores the gonadotropin response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone."

While several studies have identified neural deficits in patients with EDs, the cellular and molecular basis of the underlying dysfunction has remained poorly understood. We previously identified a rare missense mutation in the transcription factor estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA) associated with development of EDs. Because ventral-striatal signaling is related to the reward and motivation circuitry thought to underlie EDs, we performed functional and structural analysis of ventral-striatal synapses in Esrra-null mice. Esrra-null female, but not male, mice exhibit altered miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the ventral striatum, including increased frequency, increased amplitude, and decreased paired pulse ratio. These electrophysiological measures are associated with structural and molecular changes in synapses of MSNs in the ventral striatum, including fewer pre-synaptic glutamatergic vesicles and enhanced GluR1 function. Neuronal Esrra is thus required for maintaining normal synaptic function in the ventral striatum, which may offer mechanistic insights into the behavioral deficits observed in Esrra-null mice."

In contrast, the response of the HPT axis differs: DIA animals have increased TRH expression in PVN and present primary as opposed to the tertiary hypothyroidism of the FFR. Exclusive to DIA is the activation of CRHergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that project to PVN. Since TRH neurons of the PVN contain CRH receptors, we hypothesized that the differences in the response of the HPT axis to DIA could be due to CRH regulating TRHergic neurons. CRH effect was first evaluated on TRH expression of cultured hypothalamic cells where TRH mRNA levels increased after 1h with 0.1nM of CRH. We then measured the mRNA levels of CRH receptors in the PVN of male and female rats subjected to DIA; only those of CRH-R2 were modulated (down-regulated). The CRH-R2 antagonist antisauvagine-30 was therefore injected into the PVN of male rats, during the 7 days of DIA. Antisauvagine-30 induced a higher food intake than controls, and impeded the changes produced by DIA on the HPT axis: PVN TRH mRNA, and serum TH and TSH levels were decreased to similar values of FFR animals. Results corroborate the anorexigenic effect of CRH and show its role, acting through CRH-R2 receptors, in the activation of TRHergic PVN neurons caused by DIA. These new data further supports clinical trials with CRH-R2 antagonists in anorexia nervosa patients."

Subsequently, several BN-like peptides have been identified in mammals, consisting of various forms of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and/or neuromedin B (NMB), together with their distinct receptor subtypes. It has been proposed that BN-related peptides may be released from the gastrointestinal (GI)-tract in response to ingested food, and that they bridge the gut and brain (through neurocrine means) to inhibit further food intake. Conversely, the suppression of release of BN-like peptides at relevant brain nuclei may signal the initiation of a feeding episode. The present review will describe recent pharmacological, molecular, behavioral and physiological experiments, supporting the contention that endogenous BN-related peptides do indeed influence ingestive behaviors. Particular attention is focused on the relationship between these peptides in the peripheral compartment and their impact on central circuits using GRP and/or NMB as transmitters. In addition, however, we will point out various caveats and conundrums that preclude unequivocal conclusions about the precise role(s) of these peptides and their mechanism(s) of action. We conclude that BN-related peptides play an important role in the control of food intake, and may contribute to ingestive disruptions associated with anorexia (anorexia nervosa, AIDS and cancer anorexia), bulimia, obesity and depression. Hence, pharmacological targeting of these systems may be of therapeutic value."

      Reduced bone formation is associated with increased bone marrow fat in many bone-loss related diseases including aging, post-menopause, and anorexia nervosa. Several lines of evidence suggested the regulation of osteogenesis and adipogenesis of the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal (skeletal) stem cells (BMSCs) by paracrine mediators. This study aimed to investigate the impact of adipocytes-secreted factors on the cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation of BMSCs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Serum free conditioned medium (CM-Adipo) was collected from stromal ST2 cells-derived adipocytes. Cell viability, quantitative alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, Alizarin red staining for matrix mineralization and osteogenic gene array expression were performed to determine the effect of CM-Adipo on cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation of primary murine BMSCs (mBMSCs). Regulation of BMPs and NF-κB signaling pathways by CM-Adipo were detected by Western blot analysis and gene reporter assay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CM-Adipo showed no effect on cell viability/proliferation of primary mBMSCs as compared to CM-control. On the other hand, CM-Adipo significantly inhibited the commitment of mBMSCs into osteoblastic cell lineage in dose-dependent manner. CM-Adipo was found to dramatically inhibit the BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation and to activate the inflammatory NF-κB signaling in mBMSCs. Interestingly, treatment of mBMSCs with the selective inhibitor of NF-κB pathway, BAY11-770682, showed to retrieve the inhibitory effect of CM-Adipo on BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation in mBMSCs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our data demonstrated that the marrow adipocytes exert paracrine inhibitory effect on the osteoblast differentiation of mBMSCs by blocking BMPs signaling in a mechanism mediated by adipokines-induced NF-κB pathway activation."

      Adolescent rats were given 1-h unlimited access to chow and ad libitum access to a running wheel until body weight reached <80%, indicating the development of ABA. During adulthood, all groups were given 21 days of access to a palatable food for 2 h/day and ad libitum access to chow.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During adolescence, rats in the ABA paradigm developed increased wheel running and decreased food intake, reaching <80% of body weight after 3 days. However, there were no significant differences between groups in the amount of binge food consumed during adulthood.
    


          Conclusion:

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) enhance neural plasticity and their ability to enhance fear extinction learning may explain their anxiolytic properties. Caloric restriction (CR) has SSRI-like effects on neural plasticity and anxiety-related behavior. We implemented CR in mice to determine its effects on conditioned-fear responses. Wild type and serotonin transporter (SERT) knockout mice underwent CR for 7 days leading to significant weight loss. Mice were then tested for cued fear learning and anxiety-related behavior. CR markedly enhanced fear extinction learning and its retention in adolescent female mice, and adults of both sexes. These effects of CR were absent in SERT knockout mice. Moreover, CR phenocopied behavioral and molecular effects of chronic fluoxetine, but there was no additive effect of CR in fluoxetine-treated mice. These results demonstrate that CR enhances fear extinction learning through a SERT-dependent mechanism. These results may have implications for eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa (AN), in which there is a high prevalence of anxiety before the onset of dietary restriction and support proposals that in AN, CR is a motivated effort to control dysregulated fear responses and elevated anxiety."

          Conclusions:
        
      
      In rodents, reductions in leptin levels that physiologically occur following acute food deprivation or a reduction of the fat mass consequent to prolonged caloric restrictions are associated with a decrease in total locomotor activity and simultaneous increase in food-anticipatory activity, a locomotor behavior which reflects a foraging attitude. These actions can be prevented by leptin administration and are at least partially mediated by the neurons of the melanocortin pathway. In humans, twin studies have attributed to genetic factors approximately 50% of the variance of physical activity. An elevated number of the genes or loci which may affect physical activity are involved in body weight homeostasis. Polymorphisms of the melanocortin-4 and leptin receptors have repeatedly been associated with the level of physical activity. Unraveling the complexity of the regulation of locomotor behavior and the interconnections with the pathways involved in energy homeostasis may help explain the substantial individual variability in physical activities in humans and disentangle the harmful effects of sedentary lifestyle, which may be distinct from the detrimental effects of obesity."

This running activity induces increased norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin turnover in the hypothalamus. Corticosterone in plasma becomes increased while luteinizing hormone and testosterone are suppressed. In female rats cyclic gonadal function is suppressed. Running activity in the semistarved rats can be suppressed specifically by serotonin 1-c-agonists and by alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists. This animal model is helpful in the understanding of the combined effects of starvation and hyperactivity, which are observed in many patients with anorexia nervosa. The observation of the serotonergic system might help to develop a pharmacological treatment of hyperactivity in anorectic patients."

Clinical improvements include weight gain and reduced pathological hyperactivity. However the neuronal populations and mechanisms underlying OLZ actions are not known. We studied the effects of OLZ on hyperactivity using male mice lacking the hypothalamic neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCHKO) that are lean and hyperactive. We compared the in vivo effects of systemic or intra-accumbens nucleus (Acb) OLZ administration on locomotor activity in WT and MCHKO littermates. Acute systemic OLZ treatment in WT mice significantly reduced locomotor activity, an effect that is substantially attenuated in MCHKO mice. Furthermore, OLZ infusion directly into the Acb of WT mice reduced locomotor activity, but not in MCHKO mice. To identify contributing neuronal mechanisms, we assessed the effect of OLZ treatment on Acb synaptic transmission ex vivo and in vitro. Intraperitoneal OLZ treatment reduced Acb GABAergic activity in WT but not MCHKO neurons. This effect was also seen in vitro by applying OLZ to acute brain slices. OLZ reduced the frequency and amplitude of GABAergic activity that was more robust in WT than MCHKO Acb. These findings indicate that OLZ reduced Acb GABAergic transmission and that MCH is necessary for the hypolocomotor effects of OLZ."

Young female rats were singly housed in activity-wheel cages with food-restricted schedule (2, 3, or 4 h of food availability per day) for 3 weeks. Estrous cycle, body weight, food intake, and wheel revolution were recorded daily. Gastric pathology was also observed using the endoscopic technique. Rats that were subjected to either a 3- or 4-h feeding schedule exhibited the cessation of estrous cycle, loss of body weight, and suppression of food intake. These animals also showed a remarkable increase in running activity. However, they had no gastric lesions throughout the experimental period. On the contrary, the 2-h feeding schedule elicited severe gastric lesions and high mortality. The results suggest that behavioral and physiological changes of the young female rats with 3 or 4 h feeding share some symptoms of anorexia nervosa, although their anorexia is not self starvation."

Furthermore, we showed that ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1A) knockout mice do not anticipate food when exposed to the ABA model, unlike their wild type littermate controls. Likewise, food anticipatory activity in the ABA model was suppressed by a GHS-R1A antagonist administered either by acute central (ICV) injection to rats or by chronic peripheral treatment to mice. Interestingly, the GHS-R1A antagonist did not alter food intake in any of these models. Therefore, we hypothesize that suppression of the central ghrelin signaling system via GHS-R1A provides an interesting therapeutic target to treat hyperactivity in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa."

Estrogen receptors, mainly ERβ type, are commonly found in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) neurons, an important nucleus related to anxiety modulation and the primary source of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain. Taking together, these findings suggest an involvement of estrogen in anxiety modulation during food restriction, possibly mediated by ERβ activation in serotonergic DRN neurons. Thus, the present study investigated the relationship between food restriction and anxiety-like behavior, and the involvement of DRN and ERβ on the modulation of anxiety-like behaviors in animals subjected to FR. For that, female Fischer rats were grouped in control group, with free access to food, or a FR group, which received 40% of control intake during 14 days. Animals were randomly treated with 17β-estradiol (E2), DPN (ERβ selective agonist), or their respective vehicles, PBS and DMSO. Behavioral tests were performed on Elevated T-Maze (ETM) and Open Field (OF). Our results suggest that FR probably reduced the estrogen levels, since the remained in the non-ovulatory cycle phases, and their uterine weight was lower when compared to control group. The FR rats showed increased inhibitory avoidance latency in theETM indicating that FR is associated with the development of an anxiety-like state. The injections of both E2 and DPN into DRN of FR animals had an anxiolytic effect. Those data suggest thatanxiety-like behavior induced by FR could be mediated by a reduction of ERβ activation in the DRN neurons, probably due to decreased estrogen levels."

We aimed to assess gastrointestinal protein metabolism and investigate the contribution of physical activity during refeeding in C57BL/6 mice with activity-based anorexia (ABA). ABA mice exhibited lower body weight and food intake with increase of lean mass/fat mass ratio and fat oxidation. Colonic permeability was increased in ABA. Ad libitum food access was then restored and ABA group was divided into two subgroups, with access to running wheel (ABA-PA) or not (ABA-NPA). After refeeding, fat free mass was completely restored only in ABA-PA. Colonic permeability was enhanced in ABA-NPA. Finally, muscle kynurenine conversion into kynurenic acid was lower in ABA-NPA who also exhibited altered behavior. Maintaining physical activity during refeeding may thus limit colonic hyperpermeability and improve behavior in anorectic mice."

The suggested use of fluoxetine in pain relief in certain diabetics, premenstrual syndrome, and migraine headache were assessed. The reports on the use of fluoxetine in panic disorders, paraphilias, and related conditions and in the management of substance abuse, alcoholism, and cocaine abuse, were summarized and elaborated upon. A composite of preliminary reports cited in literature pertinent to the potential of fluoxetine in treatment of abusing injurious behavior, dysthymic disorder, fibrositis, postanoxicaction myoclonus, pathologic jealously, personality disorder, pseudobulbar affect, and social phobia were also reviewed.

"['Madra M', 'Zeltser LM.']",BDNF-Val66Met variant and adolescent stress interact to promote susceptibility to anorexic behavior in mice.,Transl Psychiatry,"There is an urgent need to identify therapeutic targets for anorexia nervosa (AN) because current medications do not impact eating behaviors that drive AN's high mortality rate. A major obstacle to developing new treatments is the lack of animal models that recapitulate the pattern of disease onset typically observed in human populations. Here we describe a translational mouse model to study interactions between genetic, psychological and biological risk factors that promote anorexic behavior. We combined several factors that are consistently associated with increased risk of AN-adolescent females, genetic predisposition to anxiety imposed by the BDNF-Val66Met gene variant, social isolation stress and caloric restriction (CR). Approximately 40% of the mice with all of these risk factors will exhibit severe self-imposed dietary restriction, sometimes to the point of death. We systematically varied the risk factors outlined above to explore how they interact to influence anorexic behavior. We found that the Val66Met genotype markedly increases the likelihood and severity of abnormal feeding behavior triggered by CR, but only when CR is imposed in the peri-pubertal period. Incidence of anorexic behavior in our model is dependent on juvenile exposure to social stress and can be extinguished by adolescent handling, but is discordant from anxiety-like behavior. Thus, this study characterized gene × environment interactions during adolescence that could be the underlying driver of abnormal eating behavior in certain AN patients, and represents a promising system to identify possible targets for therapeutic intervention."
"['Hancock S', 'Grant V.']",Early maternal separation increases symptoms of activity-based anorexia in male and female rats.,J Exp Psychol Anim Behav Process,"Running activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, increasing the release of stress hormones known to exert anorexic effects. HPA axis reactivity is strongly influenced by early postnatal manipulations, including removal of pups from the dam for short (handling) or prolonged (maternal separation) durations during the preweaning period. The authors examined the effects of handling and maternal separation on food intake, body weight loss, and running rates of young adult male and female rats in the activity-based anorexia (ABA) paradigm. Postnatal treatment did not affect adaptation to a 1-hr restricted feeding schedule before the introduction of wheel running. During the ABA paradigm, maternally separated animals lost weight faster, ate less, ran more, and required fewer days to reach removal criterion compared with handled rats. Females were particularly vulnerable. These findings indicate that early postnatal treatment and sex influence ABA."

We investigated the development of these features and the potential implication of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and dopaminergic signalling in their development in C57BL/6J and A/J inbred mice, using the 'activity-based anorexia' model. In this model, mice on a restricted-feeding schedule are given unlimited access to running wheels. We measured dopamine receptor D2 and BDNF expression levels in the caudate putamen and the hippocampus, respectively, using in situ hybridization. We found that in response to scheduled feeding, C57BL/6J mice reduced their running wheel activity and displayed food anticipatory activity prior to food intake from day 2 of scheduled feeding as an indication of motivation to eat. In contrast, A/J mice increased running wheel activity during scheduled feeding and lacked food anticipatory activity. These were accompanied by increased dopamine receptor D2 expression in the caudate putamen and reduced BDNF expression in the hippocampus. Consistent with human linkage and association studies on BDNF and dopamine receptor D2 in anorexia nervosa, our study shows that dopaminergic and BDNF signalling are altered as a function of susceptibility to activity-based anorexia. Differences in gene expression and behaviour between A/J and C57BL/6J mice indicate that mouse genetic mapping populations based on these progenitor lines are valuable for identifying molecular determinants of anorexia-related traits."

We previously identified cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (Cyfip2) as a genetic factor underlying compulsive-like BE in mice. CYFIP2 is a homolog of CYFIP1 which is one of four paternally-deleted genes in patients with Type I Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental disorder whereby 70% of cases involve paternal 15q11-q13 deletion. PWS symptoms include hyperphagia, obesity (if untreated), cognitive deficits, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. We tested whether Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency (+/-) would enhance compulsive-like behavior and palatable food (PF) intake in a parental origin- and sex-dependent manner on two Cyfip2 genetic backgrounds, including the BE-prone C57BL/6N (Cyfip2 N/N) background and the BE-resistant C57BL/6J (Cyfip2 J/J) background. Cyfip1 +/- mice showed increased compulsive-like behavior on both backgrounds and increased PF intake on the Cyfip2 N/N background. In contrast, maternal Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency on the BE-resistant Cyfip2 J/J background induced a robust escalation in PF intake in wild-type Cyfip1 J/J males while having no effect in Cyfip1 J/- males. Notably, induction of behavioral phenotypes in wild-type males following maternal Fmr1 +/- has previously been reported. In the hypothalamus, there was a paternally-enhanced reduction in CYFIP1 protein whereas in the nucleus accumbens, there was a maternally-enhanced reduction in CYFIP1 protein. Nochange in FMR1 protein (FMRP) was observed in Cyfip1 +/- mice, regardless of parental origin. To summarize, Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency increased compulsive-like behavior and induced genetic background-dependent, sex-dependent, and parent-of-origin-dependent effects on PF consumption and CYFIP1 expression that could have relevance for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders."

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a key peptide for stress responses such as inhibition of food intake, increases in arousal and locomotor activity, and gonadal dysfunction, is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa. CRF in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and CRF in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are involved in the regulation of stress responses, and gender differences in CRF mRNA expression in these regions in response to various stressors are controversial. We therefore examined CRF gene expression in the PVN and CeA as well as corticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone secretion in response to a 60-min period of electric footshock (FS) or psychological stress (PS) induced by a communication box in both male and female rats in proestrus or diestrus in an effort to elucidate the mechanism underlying the gender difference in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the mechanism underlying the remarkable prevalence of anorexia nervosa in females. Female rats in proestrus showed higher basal plasma ACTH and CRF mRNA expression levels in the PVN and CeA than males. Females more rapidly showed higher plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels and a higher CRF mRNA expression level in the PVN in response to FS than males. Although females in both proestrus and diestrus showed significant increases in plasma ACTH and corticosterone and CRF mRNA expression in the PVN in response to PS, no significant responses of the HPA axis to PS were found in males. FS significantly increased CRF mRNA expression in the CeA in both females and males, with significantly higher peaks in females in proestrus than in males, while PS significantly increased CRF mRNA expression in the CeA only in males. These results suggest that gender affects differentially the function of the stress-related regions such as the PVN and CeA. The finding that CRF gene expression in the PVN responds to PS only in females may be a clue to elucidation of the neurobiological mechanism underlying the gender-differential prevalence of anorexia nervosa."
"['Pinel JP', 'Assanand S', 'Lehman DR.']","Hunger, eating, and ill health.",Am Psychol,"Humans and other warm-blooded animals living with continuous access to a variety of good-tasting foods tend to eat too much and suffer ill health as a result--a finding that is incompatible with the widely held view that hunger and eating are compensatory processes that function to maintain the body's energy resources at a set point. The authors argue that because of the scarcity and unpredictability of food in nature, humans and other animals have evolved to eat to their physiological limits when food is readily available, so that excess energy can be stored in the body as a buffer against future food shortages. The discrepancy between the environment in which the hunger and eating system evolved and the food-replete environments in which many people now live has led to the current problem of overconsumption existing in many countries. This evolutionary perspective has implications for understanding the etiology of anorexia nervosa."
"['Advokat C', 'Kutlesic V.']",Pharmacotherapy of the eating disorders: a commentary.,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,"During the last 10 yr, evidence has accumulated which indicates that the eating disorders of bulimia and anorexia nervosa (BN and AN) may be differentially affected by pharmacological treatment. Although the efficacy of drug treatment alone (relative to nonpharmacological approaches) has been debated, there is support for the generalization that all types of antidepressant medications have proven efficacious for bulimia but not for anorexia. These clinical observations are consistent with an extensive body of research concerning the regulation of ingestion, which indicates that the neurotransmitter serotonin plays an important role in mediating satiety. Such considerations have led to the ""serotonin-hypothesis of bulimia,"" which postulates that BN represents an underlying ""hyposerotonergic"" condition and, conversely, that AN represents a ""hyperserotonergic"" state. Recently, however, two independent studies have shown that the antidepressant fluoxetine, which selectively blocks the synaptic re-uptake of serotonin, provided significant therapeutic benefit for anorexic patients. The implications of these apparently anomalous results for the ""serotonin-hypothesis of BN"" are discussed in an attempt to gain insight into the present pharmacotherapy of the eating disorders."

Pathophysiological, diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",Drugs,"Secretion of growth hormone (GH) is excessive in acromegaly, but also in a number of other pathological states such as anorexia nervosa, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), liver cirrhosis, depression, renal failure and GH-insensitivity syndrome. Abnormalities in the neuroendocrine control of GH secretion and/or a state of insensitivity to GH contribute to hypersecretion of GH in these states, with the possible exception of acromegaly, which appears to be a primary pituitary disease. GH hypersecretion may also occur in neonates or adolescents with tall stature, thus reflecting particular physiological or paraphysiological conditions. In the cohort of brain neurotransmitters, catecholamines and acetylcholine reportedly play a major role in the control of neurosecretory GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin (SS)-producing neurons, and hence GH secretion. Activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors or of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the hypothalamus stimulates GH release, probably through stimulation of GHRH and inhibition of SS release, respectively. Activation of dopamine receptors likewise stimulates GH release, while activation of beta-receptors inhibits GH release through stimulation of hypothalamic SS function. This review discusses the involvement of brain catecholamines and acetylcholine in GH hypersecretory states, including anorexia nervosa, acromegaly, IDDM, liver cirrhosis, depression, renal failure and GH insensitivity syndrome, with a view to providing a fuller understanding of their pathophysiology and, whenever possible, diagnostic and therapeutic implications."

We show here that mice deficient in Dmbx1 exhibit severe leanness associated with hypophagia and hyperactivity and that isolation of a Dmbx1(-/-) mouse from its cohabitants induces self-starvation, sometimes leading to death, features similar to those of anorexia nervosa in humans. Interestingly, overexpression of agouti in Dmbx1(-/-) mice failed to induce aspects of the A(y)/a phenotype, including hyperphagia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In Dmbx1(-/-) mice, administration of agouti-related protein increased cumulative food intake for the initial 6 h but significantly decreased it over 24- and 48-h periods. In addition, Dmbx1 was shown to be expressed at embryonic day 15.5 in the lateral parabrachial nucleus, the rostral nucleus of the tractus solitarius, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the reticular nucleus in the brainstem, all of which receive melanocortin signaling, indicating involvement of Dmbx1 in the development of the neural network for the signaling. Thus, Dmbx1 is essential for various actions of agouti-related protein and plays a role in normal regulation of energy homeostasis and behavior."

The hypothesis that endorphinergic deficiency may be present in endogenous depression is reviewed. Although alterations in beta-endorphin immunoreactivity measured peripherally and in CNS have not been substantiated, therapeutic trials using a mu-receptor agonist have shown promise of a rapidly-acting antidepressant effect.

This innate response can be quantified as voluntary wheel running following food restriction (FR). Paradoxically, imposing severe FR evokes voluntary FR, as some animals choose to run rather than eat, even during limited periods of food availability. This phenomenon, called activity-based anorexia (ABA), has been used to identify brain changes associated with FR and excessive exercise (EX), two core symptoms of anorexia nervosa (AN), and to explore neurobiological bases of AN vulnerability. Previously, we showed a strong positive correlation between suppression of FR-evoked hyperactivity, i.e., ABA resilience, and levels of extra-synaptic GABA receptors in stratum radiatum (SR) of hippocampal CA1. Here, we tested for the converse: whether animals with enhanced expression of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) exhibit greater levels of FR-evoked hyperactivity, i.e., ABA vulnerability. Four groups of animals were assessed for NMDAR levels at CA1 spines: (1) ABA, in which 4 days of FR was combined with wheel access to allow voluntary EX; (2) FR only; (3) EX only; and (4) control (CON) that experienced neither EX nor FR. Electron microscopy revealed that synaptic NR2A-NMDARs and NR2B-NMDARs levels are significantly elevated, relative to CONs'. Individuals' ABA severity, based on weight loss, correlated with synaptic NR2B-NMDAR levels. ABA resilience, quantified as suppression of hyperactivity, correlated strongly with reserve pools of NR2A-NMDARs in spine cytoplasm. NR2A- and NR2B-NMDAR measurements correlated with spinous prevalence of an F-actin binding protein, drebrin, suggesting that drebrin enables insertion of NR2B-NMDAR to and retention of NR2A-NMDARs away from synaptic membranes, together influencing ABA vulnerability."

Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), serotonin (5-HT) and its 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) are implicated in anorexia. Rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine, has been used to treat anorexia and gastrointestinal disorders. The present study aimed to clarify whether rikkunshito influences the 5-HT action on ARC POMC neurons. We isolated single neurons from the ARC of adult rats and measured cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺](i)) by fura-2 microfluorometry combined with immunocytochemical identification of POMC neurons. Administration of 5-HT increased [Ca²⁺](i) in ARC neurons, and 80% of the 5-HT-responsive neurons were immunoreactive to POMC. Rikkunshito concentration-dependently and 5-HT2CR antagonist SB242084 significantly suppressed 5-HT-induced [Ca²⁺](i) increases. The rikkunshito-suppressed neurons highly overlapped SB242084-suppressed neurons. Isoliquiritigenin, an ingredient of rikkunshito, suppressed 5-HT-induced [Ca²⁺](i) increases to a lesser extent than rikkunshito. These results demonstrate that rikkunshito counteracts 5-HT-induced 5-HT2CR-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling in ARC POMC neurons, and that isoliquiritigenin may serve as an active component of rikkunshito. The ability of rikkunshito to antagonize 5-HT action in ARC POMC neurons could underlie the rikkunshito's action to attenuate anorexia induced by excessive 5-HT release and/or action associated with psychiatric diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, and anti-cancer medicines."

We tested the effects of chlorpromazine (2mg/kg IP) on the acute WIFS in 40 adult male rats by administering the drug before or after 3h of daytime wheel access and measuring food consumption over the subsequent 24h. Control groups received saline injections or were exposed to locked wheels. While chlorpromazine did not attenuate feeding or change wheel running alone, it blocked their interaction, the acute WIFS. This procedure might be useful in screening drugs for anorexia nervosa where exercise is often elevated and feeding is suppressed."
['Smith SS.'],The influence of stress at puberty on mood and learning: role of the α4βδ GABAA receptor.,Neuroscience,"It is well-known that the onset of puberty is associated with changes in mood as well as cognition. Stress can have an impact on these outcomes, which in many cases, can be more influential in females, suggesting that gender differences exist. The adolescent period is a vulnerable time for the onset of certain psychopathologies, including anxiety disorders, depression and eating disorders, which are also more prevalent in females. One factor which may contribute to stress-triggered anxiety at puberty is the GABAA receptor (GABAR), which is known to play a pivotal role in anxiety. Expression of α4βδ GABARs increases on the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells at the onset of puberty in the hippocampus, part of the limbic circuitry which governs emotion. This receptor is a sensitive target for the stress steroid 3α-OH-5[α]β-pregnan-20-one or [allo]pregnanolone, which paradoxically reduces inhibition and increases anxiety during the pubertal period (post-natal day ∼35-44) of female mice in contrast to its usual effect to enhance inhibition and reduce anxiety. Spatial learning and synaptic plasticity are also adversely impacted at puberty, likely a result of increased expression of α4βδ GABARs on the dendritic spines of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, which are essential for consolidation of memory. This review will focus on the role of these receptors in mediating behavioral changes at puberty. Stress-mediated changes in mood and cognition in early adolescence may have relevance for the expression of psychopathologies in adulthood."
['Tsai SJ.'],Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: a possible novel therapeutic approach to eating disorders.,Med Hypotheses,"The two most common eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, are characterized by aberrant eating patterns and disturbances in body image. Treatment involves combining individual, behavioural, group, and family therapies, possibly with medications. Studies have found that medication, chiefly antidepressants, could be of help in bulimia nervosa but the evidence is weaker for use in anorexia nervosa. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive technique that briefly stimulates or depresses cortical areas within the brain. It has been used in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, especially major depression, which is a condition that patients with eating disorders often experience as a significant comorbidity. Given that both disorders may share a common pathogenesis, this report proposes that rTMS may represent an alternative strategy for the treatment of eating disorders. Other evidence that supports this notion comes from animal studies that show that rTMS can change feeding behaviours and central neurotransmitters related to the regulation of eating behaviours. Further investigation into the dose, duration and type of rTMS stimulus is needed to verify the efficacy of this intervention in eating disorders."

The discovery that High-Frequency Stimulation (HFS) mimics the effect of lesioning has opened a new field of therapeutic application of electrical stimulation in all places where lesion of neuronal structures, such as nuclei of the basal ganglia, had proven some therapeutic efficiency. This was first applied to the thalamus to mimic thalamotomy for the treatment of tremor, then to the subthalamic nucleus and the pallidum to treat some advanced forms of Parkinson's disease and control not only the tremor but also akinesia, rigidity and dyskinesias. The field of application is increasingly growing, currently encompassing dystonias, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disease, cluster headaches, and experimental approaches are being made in the field of obesity and food intake control. Although the effects of stimulation are clear-cut and the therapeutic benefit is clearly recognized, the mechanism of action of HFS is not yet understood. The similarity between HFS and the effect of lesions in several places of the brain suggests that this might induce an inhibition-like process, which is difficult to explain with the classical concept of physiology where electrical stimulation means excitation of neural elements. The current data coming from either clinical or experimental observations are providing elements to shape a beginning of an understanding. Intra-cerebral recordings in human patients with artefact suppression tend to show the arrest of electrical firing in the recorded places. Animal experiments, either in vitro or in vivo, show complex patterns mixing inhibitory effects and frequency stimulation induced bursting activity, which would suggest that the mechanism is based upon the jamming of the neuronal message, which is by this way functionally suppressed. More recent data from in vitro biological studies show that HFS profoundly affects the cellular functioning and particularly the protein synthesis, suggesting that it could alter the synaptic transmission by reducing the production of neurotransmitters. It is now clear that this method has a larger field of application than currently known and that its therapeutical applications will benefit to several diseases of the nervous system. The understanding of the mechanism has opened a new field of research, which will call for reappraisal of the basic effects of electricity on the living tissues."
"['Rieg TS', 'Aravich PF.']",Systemic clonidine increases feeding and wheel running but does not affect rate of weight loss in rats subjected to activity-based anorexia.,Pharmacol Biochem Behav,"Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is an animal model of anorexia nervosa with two characteristics of the disorder, decreased food intake and increased activity. We have shown that chronic noradrenergic stimulation of the paraventricular hypothalamus exacerbates ABA rather than ameliorates it. This study determined if peripheral chronic administration of clonidine affects ABA. Rats were implanted SC with osmotic minipumps infusion 0, 30, or 300 micrograms/kg/day of clonidine and exposed to ABA (1.5 h/day ad lib food, 22.5 h/day ad lib wheel access). Results showed that clonidine did not affect the rate of weight loss during ABA, but increased food intake at the lower dose and wheel activity at the higher dose. It is proposed that increased energy expenditure due to wheel running is counteracted by an inhibition of sympathetically mediated diet-induced thermogenesis, and that the elevation in running by the higher dose potentially increases the risk of developing ABA."
['Ishii DN.'],Implication of insulin-like growth factors in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.,Brain Res Brain Res Rev,"Neuropathy can be a highly debilitating complication for about 10-15% of diabetic individuals. Unfortunately, the complex syndrome has proven difficult to explain and a consensus as to its cause has not emerged. It has recently come to light that insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have neurotrophic actions on sensory, sympathetic and motor neurons. These are the main types of neurons afflicted in this disorder. Moreover, IGF activity is reduced in both clinical and experimental diabetes. The premise that insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II provide redundant neurotrophic support underlies the following new theory for pathogenesis of diabetic neural disturbances: a loss of insulin activity leads to a secondary partial decline in IGF-I activity. Although most of the redundant neurotrophic support is thereby eliminated, IGF-II activity continues to support the nervous system. The final enemy is time and the relentless age- and duration-dependent run-down of IGF activity is suggested to contribute to the age- and duration-dependent neuropathy. Weight loss or anorexia nervosa are independent risk factors that can cause a rapid, painful neuropathy to develop as a result of a rapid loss of IGF activity. A distinguishing feature of this new theory is that hyperglycemia is not considered to be the main culprit. The following critical predictions from the theory were tested in diabetic rats: (i) IGF activity is reduced in diabetic neural tissues; (ii) conduction velocity is impaired in the diabetic spinal cord; (iii) replacement therapy with IGF can prevent neuropathy in diabetic nerves; and (iv) IGFs can prevent diabetic neuropathy, despite hyperglycemia. All of these predictions have been validated. It is hoped that a fresh perspective will stimulate renewed study into the causation of this most unfortunate disorder."
"['Koob GF', 'Heinrichs SC.']",A role for corticotropin releasing factor and urocortin in behavioral responses to stressors.,Brain Res,"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and CRF-related neuropeptides have an important role in the central nervous system to mediate behavioral responses to stressors. CRF receptor antagonists are very effective in reversing stress-induced suppression and activation in behavior. An additional CRF-like neuropeptide, urocortin, has been identified in the brain and has a high affinity for the CRF-2 receptor in addition to the CRF-1 receptor. Urocortin has many of the effects of CRF but also is significantly more potent than CRF in decreasing feeding in both meal-deprived and free-feeding rats. In mouse genetic models, mice over-expressing CRF show anxiogenic-like responses compared to wild-type mice, and mice lacking the CRF-1 receptor showed an anxiolytic-like behavioral profile compared to wild-type mice. Results to date have led to the hypothesis that CRF-1 receptors may mediate CRF-like neuropeptide effects on behavioral responses to stressors, but CRF-2 receptors may mediate the suppression of feeding produced by CRF-like neuropeptides. Brain sites for the behavioral effects of CRF include the locus coeruleus (LC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the central nucleus of the amygdala. CRF may also be activated during acute withdrawal from all major drugs of abuse, and recent data suggest that CRF may contribute to the dependence and vulnerability to relapse associated with chronic administration of drugs of abuse. These data suggest that CRF systems in the brain have a unique role in mediating behavioral responses to diverse stressors. These systems may be particularly important in situations were an organism must mobilize not only the pituitary adrenal system, but also the central nervous system in response to environmental challenge. Clearly, dysfunction in such a fundamental brain-activating system may be the key to a variety of pathophysiological conditions involving abnormal responses to stressors such as anxiety disorders, affective disorders, and anorexia nervosa."
['Levenson CW.'],Zinc regulation of food intake: new insights on the role of neuropeptide Y.,Nutr Rev,"The role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in feeding behavior and zinc deficiency-induced anorexia has been controversial because hypothalamic NPY levels are elevated in both zinc deficiency and food restriction. A recent report shows that while NPY is released from terminals in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of food-restricted animals, this release is significantly impaired in zinc-deficient animals. Zinc deficiency may therefore cause anorexia by inhibiting the release of NPY that is required for receptor activation."

['Klump KL.'],Puberty as a critical risk period for eating disorders: a review of human and animal studies.,Horm Behav,"This article is part of a Special Issue ""Puberty and Adolescence"". Puberty is one of the most frequently discussed risk periods for the development of eating disorders. Prevailing theories propose environmentally mediated sources of risk arising from the psychosocial effects (e.g., increased body dissatisfaction, decreased self-esteem) of pubertal development in girls. However, recent research highlights the potential role of ovarian hormones in phenotypic and genetic risk for eating disorders during puberty. The goal of this paper is to review data from human and animal studies in support of puberty as a critical risk period for eating disorders and evaluate the evidence for hormonal contributions. Data are consistent in suggesting that both pubertal status and pubertal timing significantly impact risk for most eating disorders in girls, such that advanced pubertal development and early pubertal timing are associated with increased rates of eating disorders and their symptoms in both cross-sectional and longitudinal research. Findings in boys have been much less consistent and suggest a smaller role for puberty in risk for eating disorders in boys. Twin and animal studies indicate that at least part of the female-specific risk is due to genetic factors associated with estrogen activation at puberty. In conclusion, data thus far support a role for puberty in risk for eating disorders and highlight the need for additional human and animal studies of hormonal and genetic risk for eating disorders during puberty."

To characterize the role of the 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1A-R) in these eating disorders in females, we investigated the effect of saline or 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) treatment on feeding behavior and body weight in adult WT female mice and in adult 5-HT1A-R knockout (KO) female mice. Our results showed that KO female mice have lower food intake and body weight than WT female mice. Administration of 8-OH-DPAT decreased food intake but not body weight in WT female mice. Furthermore, qRT-PCR was employed to analyze the expression levels of neuropeptides, γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor subunit β (GABAA β subunits) and glutamic acid decarboxylase in the hypothalamic area. The results showed the difference in food intake between WT and KO mice was accompanied by differential expression of POMC, CART and GABAA β2, and the difference in body weight between WT and KO mice was associated with significantly different expression levels of CART and GABAA β2. As such, our data provide new insight into the role of 5-HT1A-R in both feeding behavior and the associated expression of neuropeptides and the GABAA receptor."
"['Ghigo E', 'Arvat E', 'Camanni F.']",Orally active growth hormone secretagogues: state of the art and clinical perspectives.,Ann Med,"Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) are synthetic, non-natural peptidyl and nonpeptidyl molecules with potent stimulatory effect on somatotrope secretion. They have no structural homology with growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and act via a specific receptor, which has now been cloned and is present at both the pituitary and hypothalamic level. This evidence strongly suggests the existence of a still unknown natural GHS-like ligand. Several data favour the hypothesis that GHS could counteract somatostatinergic activity at both the pituitary and hypothalamic level and/or, at least partially, via a GHRH-mediated mechanism. However, the possibility that they act via an unknown hypothalamic factor remains open. GH-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6) is the first hexapeptide studied extensively in humans. More recently, peptidyl superanalogues GHRP-1, GHRP-2 and hexarelin, and nonpeptidyl mimetics, such as the spiroindoline derivative MK-677, have been synthesized and their effects have been studied in humans. The GH-releasing activity of GHS is marked, dose related and reproducible after intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal and even oral administration. The effect of GHS is partially desensitized but prolonged, intermittent oral administration increases insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels. The GH-releasing effect of GHS undergoes age-related variations; it increases from birth to puberty, remains similar in adulthood and decreases with ageing. The effect of GHS on GH release is synergistic with that of GHRH, while it is only partially refractory to inhibitory influences, which nearly abolish the effect of GHRH. GHS maintain their GH-releasing activity in some somatotrope hypersecretory states such as acromegaly, anorexia nervosa, hyperthyroidism and critical illness. The GH response to GHS has been reported clear although reduced in GH deficiency, obesity and hypothyroidism, while it is strongly reduced in patients with pituitary stalk disconnection or Cushing's syndrome. In short children, elderly subjects, critically ill patients and even in adult patients with GH deficiency an increase of IGF-I has been shown after GHS treatment. These data indicate that treatment with orally active GHS in humans enhances the activity of the GH-IGF-I axis and could be clinically useful."
"['Sinclair EB', 'Culbert KM', 'Gradl DR', 'Richardson KA', 'Klump KL', 'Sisk CL.']",Differential mesocorticolimbic responses to palatable food in binge eating prone and binge eating resistant female rats.,Physiol Behav,"Binge eating is a key symptom of many eating disorders (e.g. binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa binge/purge type), yet the neurobiological underpinnings of binge eating are poorly understood. The mesocorticolimbic reward circuit, including the nucleus accumbens and the medial prefrontal cortex, is likely involved because this circuit mediates the hedonic value and incentive salience of palatable foods (PF). Here we tested the hypothesis that higher propensity for binge eating is associated with a heightened response (i.e., Fos induction) of the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex to PF, using an animal model that identifies binge eating prone (BEP) and binge eating resistant (BER) rats. Forty adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were given intermittent access to PF (high fat pellets) 3×/week for 3 weeks. Based on a pattern of either consistently high or consistently low PF consumption across these feeding tests, 8 rats met criteria for categorization as BEP, and 11 rats met criteria for categorization as BER. One week after the final feeding test, BEP and BER rats were either exposed to PF in their home cages or were given no PF in their home cages for 1h prior to perfusion, leading to three experimental groups for the Fos analysis: BEPs given PF, BERs given PF, and a No PF control group. The total number of Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-ir) cells in the nucleus accumbens core and shell, and the cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic regions of the medial prefrontal cortex was estimated by stereological analysis. PF induced higher Fos expression in the nucleus accumbens shell and core and in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortex of BEP rats compared to No PF controls. Throughout the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, PF induced higher Fos expression in BEP than in BER rats, even after adjusting for differences in PF intake. Differences in the neural activation pattern between BEP and BER rats were more robust in prefrontal cortex than in nucleus accumbens. These data confirm that PF activates brain regions responsible for encoding the incentive salience and hedonic properties of PF, and suggest that binge eating proneness is associated with enhanced responses to PF in brain regions that exert executive control over food reward."

Although hyperactivity has been linked to dopaminergic signalling, the causal relationship between midbrain dopamine neuronal activity and locomotor hyperactivity remains unknown. In this study, we test whether increased dopamine neuronal activity is sufficient to induce locomotor hyperactivity. To do so, we used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) to chemogenetically enhance neuronal activity in two main midbrain dopamine neuron populations, i.e. the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SN), in TH:Cre rats. We found that activation of VTA dopamine neurons induced a pronounced and long-lasting hyperactive phenotype, whilst SN dopamine neuron activation only modestly increased home cage locomotion. Furthermore, this hyperactive phenotype was replicated by selective activation of the neuronal pathway from VTA to the nucleus accumbens (NAC). These results show a clear functional difference between neuronal subpopulations in the VTA and SN with regards to inducing locomotor hyperactivity, and suggest that the dopaminergic pathway from VTA to NAC may be a promising target for the treatment of hyperactivity disorders."

By scheduled feeding and voluntary wheel running, it mimics severe body weight loss and increased physical activity in AN. Pharmacological, genetic and imaging studies implicate dopamine and serotonin in the regulation of feeding behavior, food-anticipatory activity, and food reward. Previous studies propose that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an important role in these food-related processes. Here we determined dopamine and serotonin levels in the NAc upon exposure to the ABA model. Surprisingly, the release of dopamine and serotonin in the NAc were not increased during the initiation of food-anticipatory behavior in ABA rats. Dopamine release in the NAc was increased during feeding behavior in ABA rats. During ABA, levels of serotonin were low and circadian activity is blunted. We conclude that during the early stages of development of food-anticipatory activity, increased dopamine does not trigger hyperactivity."

The cellular and molecular mechanisms that link energy balance and central regulation of reproduction are still not well understood. Peripheral hormones such as estradiol, testosterone and leptin, as well as neuropeptides like kisspeptin and neuropeptides Y (NPY) play a potential role in regulation of reproduction and energy balance with their primary target converging on the hypothalamic median eminence-arcuate region. The present study was aimed to explore the effects of negative energy state resulting from intermittent fasting dietary restriction (IF-DR) regimen on complete hypothalamo-hypophysial-gonadal axis in Wistar strain young female and male rats. Significant changes in body weight, blood glucose, estrous cyclicity and serum estradiol, testosterone and LH level indicated the negative role of IF-DR regimen on reproduction in these young animals. Further, it was elucidated whether serum level of metabolic hormone, leptin plays a mechanistic role in suppressing hypothalamo-hypophysial-gonadal (HPG) axis via energy regulators, kisspeptin and NPY in rats on IF-DR regimen. We also studied the effect of IF-DR regimen on structural remodeling of GnRH axon terminals in median eminence region of hypothalamus along with the glial cell marker, GFAP and neuronal plasticity marker, PSA-NCAM using immunostaining, Western blotting and RT-PCR. Together these data suggest that IF-DR regimen negatively influences reproduction in young animals due to its adverse effects on complete hypothalamus-hypophysial-gonadal axis and may explain underlying mechanism(s) to understand the clinical basis of nutritional infertility."
"['Guneli E', 'Gumustekin M', 'Ates M.']",Possible involvement of ghrelin on pain threshold in obesity.,Med Hypotheses,"Pain threshold (or perception) can increase or decrease according to some factors like gender, depression or individual differences. Also, previous studies showed that pain threshold can change in obesity but, these studies on the effects of obesity on pain threshold have given controversial results. In the obese people who were exposed to pain stimulation to determined pain threshold, an increased pain threshold was observed. Contrarily, in the studies using electrophysiological test had lower pain threshold, which indicates a reverse correlation between degree of overweight and the threshold of the nociceptive reflex. These studies indicate possible interrelationships between the endogenous opioids, nociception and obesity or eating behavior. Nevertheless, its mechanism is still unclear. The endocrine changes that play an important role in obesity can lead an increase or decrease in pain threshold. There are a few researches about these hormonal factors which are related to pain pathways, that they are nociceptive (like leptin) or antinociceptive effect (like ghrelin, orexin A and B). Ghrelin is one of the hormones which is related to obesity. There are studies which prove the relationship between this hormone and the systems that play a role in pain modulation in the brain. However, there is no previous knowledge about the effects of ghrelin on pain threshold in obesity. But, many strong evidence are present to hypothesise that ghrelin may have effects on pain threshold. Obesity and fasting are the two main situations in which ghrelin secretion is mostly modified. Circulating ghrelin levels negatively correlate with BMI, meaning increased ghrelin secretion during fasting, malnutrition, cachexia, and in anorexia nervosa and reduced ghrelin secretion in obesity. Therefore, we have the opinion that ghrelin play an important role in obesity-pain relationship and/or regulate other systems that are related to pain pathway. Based on the above analyses, we propose a hypothesis that the diminution of the susceptibility to pain in lean subjects/animals may be induced by the increase in endogenous ghrelin activity, or increased of the susceptibility to pain in obese subject/animals may be induced by the decrease in endogenous ghrelin activity."
['Janeckova R.'],The role of leptin in human physiology and pathophysiology.,Physiol Res,"This review focuses on current knowledge of leptin biology and the role of leptin in various physiological and pathophysiological states. Leptin is involved in the regulation of body weight. Serum leptin can probably be considered as one of the best biological markers reflecting total body fat in both animals and humans. Obesity in man is accompanied by increased circulating leptin concentrations. Gender differences clearly exist. Leptin is not only correlated to a series of endocrine parameters such as insulin, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, testosterone, but it also seems to be involved in mediating some endocrine mechanisms (onset of puberty, insulin secretion) and diseases (obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome). It has also been suggested that leptin can act as a growth factor in the fetus and the neonate."

In female mice, we evaluated the impact of voluntary physical activity with/without chronic food restriction on metabolic and endocrine parameters that might contribute to AN. In this protocol, FRW mice (i.e., food restriction with running wheel) reached a crucial point of body weight loss (especially fat mass) faster than FR mice (i.e., food restriction only). However, in contrast to FR mice, their body weight stabilized, demonstrating a protective effect of a moderate, regular physical activity. Exercise delayed meal initiation and duration. FRW mice displayed food anticipatory activity compared with FR mice, which was strongly diminished with the prolongation of the protocol. The long-term nature of the protocol enabled assessment of bone parameters similar to those observed in AN patients. Both restricted groups adapted their energy metabolism differentially in the short and long term, with less fat oxidation in FRW mice and a preferential use of glucose to compensate for the chronic energy imbalance. Finally, like restrictive AN patients, FRW mice exhibited low leptin levels, high plasma concentrations of corticosterone and ghrelin, and a disruption of the estrous cycle. In conclusion, our model suggests that physical activity has beneficial effects on the adaptation to the severe condition of food restriction despite the absence of any protective effect on lean and bone mass."

A biological predisposition to eating disorders may result from these atypical opioid systems. Definition of these systems as atypical is based on their responses to morphine, which are preferential for the mu receptor subtype. Three patterns have been described in four strains of mice: anorexia with hyperactivity (BALB/C and C57BL/J), anorexia without hyperactivity (DBA/J), and a biphasic curve (CF-1). The latter showed anorexia and hyperactivity at high doses but increased food intake without a change in motor activity at low doses. These patterns contrast to the increase in food intake and sedation in typical species, including rats and normal humans. In the present study, U50,488, a selective kappa agonist, increases food intake in all four mouse strains, as previously reported in rats. Thus, these two agonists have opposite effects on the atypical mouse systems, but similar effects on the typical rat system. The typical and atypical opioid systems respond oppositely to morphine but similarly to U50,488."
['De Souza EB.'],"Corticotropin-releasing factor receptors: physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry and role in central nervous system and immune disorders.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays a major role in coordinating the endocrine, autonomic, behavioral and immune responses to stress through actions in the brain and the periphery. CRF receptors identified in brain, pituitary and spleen have comparable kinetic and pharmacological characteristics, guanine nucleotide sensitivity and adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity. Differences were observed in the molecular mass of the CRF receptor complex between the brain (58,000 Da) and the pituitary and spleen (75,000 Da), which appeared to be due to differential glycosylation of the receptor proteins. The recently cloned CRF receptor in the pituitary and the brain (designated as CRF1) encodes a 415 amino acid protein comprising seven putative membrane-spanning domains and is structurally related to the calcitonin/vasoactive intestinal peptide/growth hormone-releasing hormone subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. A second member of the CRF receptor family encoding a 411 amino acid rat brain protein with approximately 70% homology to CRF1 has recently been identified (designated as CRF2); there exists an additional splice variant of the CRF2 receptor with a different N-terminal domain encoding a protein of 431 amino acids. In autoradiographic studies, CRF receptors were localized in highest densities in the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, amygdala, cerebellum and the macrophage-enriched zones and red pulp regions of the spleen. CRF can modulate the number of CRF receptors in a reciprocal manner. For example, stress and adrenalectomy increase hypothalamic CRF secretion which, in turn, down-regulates CRF receptors in the anterior pituitary. CRF receptors in the brain and pituitary are also altered as a consequence of the development and aging processes. In addition to a physiological role for CRF in integrating the responses of the brain, endocrine and immune systems to physiological, psychological and immunological stimuli, recent clinical data implicate CRF in the etiology and pathophysiology of various endocrine, psychiatric, neurologic and inflammatory illnesses. Hypersecretion of CRF in the brain may contribute to the symptomatology seen in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety-related disorders and anorexia nervosa. Furthermore, overproduction of CRF at peripheral inflammatory sites, such as synovial joints may contribute to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast, deficits in brain CRF are apparent in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, as they relate to dysfunction of CRF neurons in the brain areas affected in the particular disorder. Strategies directed at developing CRF-related agents may hold promise for novel therapies for the treatment of these various disorders."

In an animal model with chronic abnormalities of energy expenditure, appetitive behavior, and body weight, without acute food restriction, we found alterations in peripheral levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone, but no alterations in the expression of neuropeptides genes that are known to regulate ingestive behavior and food intake acutely. Our data suggest that activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in activity anorexia may not be due to increased transcription of corticotropin-releasing hormone gene, but might be related to posttranscriptional events or to other neuropeptides, such as arginine vasopressin. Furthermore, we suggest that abnormalities in neuropeptides observed in eating disorders may be caused by acute food restriction, rather than by chronic hyperactivity, anorexia, and low weight."
['Morley JE.'],An approach to the development of drugs for appetite disorders.,Neuropsychobiology,"This review covers some modern concepts in the development of drugs to treat appetite disorders. Specific attention is paid to the peripheral satiety system and the role of gastrointestinal peptides such as cholecystokinin in the pathogenesis of satiety. Alterations in neuropeptide Y and/or peptide YY are suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of bulimia. Corticotropin-releasing factor is a putative candidate peptide involved in anorexia nervosa. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors fenfluramine and fluoxetene decrease weight in obese subjects. Endogenous opioids modulate the choice of palatable foods. Anorexia in the old appears to be related to a decrease in opioid feeding drive and an excess of the satiety action of cholecystokinin. Other agents involved in weight regulation include those which alter gastric emptying, increase thermogenesis, or modulate fat cell metabolism. It should be stressed that many neurotransmitters that modulate appetite also alter other behaviors, increasing their propensity to produce side effects."
"['Petrovich GD', 'Lougee MA.']",Sex differences in fear-induced feeding cessation: prolonged effect in female rats.,Physiol Behav,"Fear inhibits food intake. Cessation of eating in anticipation of danger is an adaptive response that prepares an organism for an imminent threat, but it could become maladaptive when persistent. To begin to examine the underlying mechanisms, we developed an animal model for fear-cue induced inhibition of feeding. In that preparation, food-deprived rats stop eating when presented with a tone that signals a foot-shock based on prior associations. Here, we examined whether there are sex differences in adult male and female rats. We found that female rats showed sustained fear-cue induced feeding inhibition compared to males during the extinction. During the first of four extinction tests with tone presentations, both male and female rats showed similar, robust cessation of eating. Rats of both sexes that previously received tone-shock pairings ate significantly less than the control rats that received tones without shocks during training. Male rats extinguished this behavior during the second test, while females continued to show the effect during the second and third tests, and extinguished during the fourth test. The findings provide a novel framework for investigation of sex differences in the control of feeding and the underlying brain substrates. The animal model may also be informative for understanding human eating and associated disorders. In particular, the potential contribution of fear in the maintenance of low food intake in anorexia nervosa is hypothesized."

      Nutritional interventions often fail to prevent growth failure in childhood and adolescent malnutrition and the mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies revealed altered microbiota in malnourished children and anorexia nervosa. To facilitate mechanistic studies under physiologically relevant conditions, we established a mouse model of growth failure following chronic dietary restriction and examined microbiota in relation to age, diet, body weight, and anabolic treatment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Four-week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 12/group) were fed ad libitum (AL) or offered limited food to abolish weight gain (LF). A subset of restricted mice was treated with an insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) analog. Food access was restored in a subset of untreated LF (LF-RF) and IGF1-treated LF mice (TLF-RF) on day 97. Gut microbiota were determined on days 69, 96-99 and 120 by next generation sequencing of the V3-5 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbiota-host factor associations were analyzed by distance-based PERMANOVA and quantified by the coefficient of determination R2 for age, diet, and normalized body weight change (Δbwt). Microbial taxa on day 120 were compared following fitting with an overdispersed Poisson regression model. The machine learning algorithm Random Forests was used to predict age based on the microbiota.

      On day 120, Δbwt in AL, LF, LF-RF, and TLF-RF mice was 52 ± 3, -6 ± 1*, 40 ± 3*, and 46 ± 2 % (*, P < 0.05 versus AL). Age and diet, but not Δbwt, were associated with gut microbiota composition. Age explained a larger proportion of the microbiota variability than diet or Δbwt. Random Forests predicted chronological age based on the microbiota and indicated microbiota immaturity in the LF mice before, but not after, refeeding. However, on day 120, the microbiota community structure of LF-RF mice was significantly different from that of both AL and LF mice. IGF1 mitigated the difference from the AL group. Refed groups had a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and a lower abundance of Firmicutes than AL mice.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Persistent growth failure can be induced by 97-day dietary restriction in young female mice and is associated with microbiota changes seen in lean mice and individuals and anorexia nervosa. IGF1 facilitates recovery of body weights and microbiota."

Because of the relationship between exercise and AN, there is interest in the weight-loss phenomenon produced by exercise in food restricted rats. This investigation determined if the weight-loss phenomenon is associated with a paradoxical suppression of food intake following 2DG and if the effect is related to reductions in prevailing glucose and insulin levels. Weight-matched, normal-weight exercised and normal-weight unexercised rats served as controls. As predicted, 2DG reduced food intake in animals subjected to the phenomenon (1.5 h/day food access and 22.5 h/day running wheel access). This effect was related to reductions in plasma glucose and insulin under the conditions that prevailed at the time of injection. Since these changes also occurred in weight-matched controls, they were attributed to the general effects of weight loss. A situational specificity for the ""anorexia"" of the weight-loss syndrome was also demonstrated. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of the phenomenon as a model of AN were considered."

Clinical applications of corticotropin-releasing factor.,Ann Intern Med,"Ovine and human corticotropin-releasing factors (CRF) have similar potencies in causing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol secretion in normal humans. Using long-acting ovine CRF (1 microgram/kg body weight as an intravenous bolus), we tested patients with Cushing's syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, and psychiatric conditions with mild hypercortisolism. Over 95% of hypercortisolemic patients with a pituitary adenoma responded with increases in plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations; patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome had no ACTH or cortisol responses; patients with ACTH-independent hypercortisolism of adrenal origin had low or undetectable plasma ACTH concentrations before and after CRF without any cortisol response. The differences in responses of patients with adrenal insufficiency of primary, pituitary, or suprapituitary type likewise suggest value of the CFR test in their differential diagnosis. The responses in the psychiatric patients should permit differentiation between Cushing's syndrome and hypercortisolism of psychiatric origin."

We used an animal model of AN, called activity-based anorexia (ABA), to investigate the neurobiological basis of vulnerability to repeated, food restriction (FR) stress-evoked anxiety. Twenty-one of 23 adolescent female mice responded to the 1st FR with increased wheel-running activity (WRA), even during the limited period of food access, thereby capturing AN's symptoms of voluntary FR and over-exercise. Baseline WRA was an excellent predictor of FR-elicited WRA (severity of ABA, SOA), with high baseline runners responding to FR with minimal SOA (i.e., negative correlation). Nine gained resistance to ABA following the 1st FR. Even though allopregnanolone (3α-OH-5α-pregnan-20-one, THP), the metabolite of progesterone (P4), is a well-recognized anxiolytic agent, subcutaneous P4 to these ABA-resistant animals during the 2nd FR was exacerbative, evoking greater WRA than the counterpart resistant group that received oil vehicle, only. Moreover, P4 had no WRA-reducing effect on animals that remained ABA-vulnerable. To explain the sensitizing effect of P4 upon the resistant mice, we examined the relationship between P4 treatment and levels of the α4 subunit of GABAARs at spines of pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1, a parameter previously shown to correlate with resistance to ABA. α4 levels at spine membrane correlated strongly and negatively with SOA during the 1st ABA (prior to P4 injection), confirming previous findings. α4 levels were greater among P4-treated animals that had gained resistance than of vehicle-treated resistant animals or of the vulnerable animals with or without P4. We propose that α4-GABAARs play a protective role by counterbalancing the ABA-induced increase in excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and although exogenous P4's metabolite, THP, enhances α4 expression, especially among those that can gain resistance, it also interferes with α4-GABAARs' protective role by desensitizing α4-GABAARs."

Previous data indicated that immunoglobulins (Igs) or autoantibodies (auto-Abs) reactive with α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) are involved in regulation of feeding and emotion; however, the origin of such auto-Abs is unknown. Here, using proteomics, we identified ClpB heat-shock disaggregation chaperone protein of commensal gut bacteria Escherichia coli as a conformational antigen mimetic of α-MSH. We show that ClpB-immunized mice produce anti-ClpB IgG crossreactive with α-MSH, influencing food intake, body weight, anxiety and melanocortin receptor 4 signaling. Furthermore, chronic intragastric delivery of E. coli in mice decreased food intake and stimulated formation of ClpB- and α-MSH-reactive antibodies, while ClpB-deficient E. coli did not affect food intake or antibody levels. Finally, we show that plasma levels of anti-ClpB IgG crossreactive with α-MSH are increased in patients with AN, bulimia and BED, and that the ED Inventory-2 scores in ED patients correlate with anti-ClpB IgG and IgM, which is similar to our previous findings for α-MSH auto-Abs. In conclusion, this work shows that the bacterial ClpB protein, which is present in several commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, can be responsible for the production of auto-Abs crossreactive with α-MSH, associated with altered feeding and emotion in humans with ED. Our data suggest that ClpB-expressing gut microorganisms might be involved in the etiology of EDs."

Female reproductive function is vulnerable to effects from dietary restrictions, suggesting a transient adaptation that prioritizes individual survival over reproduction until a possible future opportunity for satiation. This adaptation could also partially explain the existence of amenorrhea in women with anorexia nervosa. Because amino acid nutritional conditions other than caloric restriction uniquely alters amino acid metabolism and affect the hormonal levels of organisms, we hypothesized that the supply of essential amino acids in the diet plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of the female reproductive system. To test this hypothesis, we examined ovulatory cyclicity in female rats under diets that were deficient in threonine, lysine, tryptophan, methionine or valine. Ovulatory cyclicity was monitored by daily cytological evaluations of vaginal smears. After continuous feeding of the deficient diet, a persistent diestrus or anovulatory state was induced most quickly by the valine-deficient diet and most slowly by the lysine-deficient diet. A decline in the systemic insulin-like growth factor 1 level was associated with a dietary amino acid deficiency. Furthermore, a paired group of rats that were fed an isocaloric diet with balanced amino acids maintained normal estrous cyclicity. These disturbances of the estrous cycle by amino acid deficiency were quickly reversed by the consumption of a normal diet. The continuous anovulatory state in this study is not attributable to a decrease in caloric intake but to an imbalance in the dietary amino acid composition. With a shortage of well-balanced amino acid sources, reproduction becomes risky for both the mother and the fetus. It could be viewed as an adaptation to the diet, diverting resources away from reproduction and reallocating them to survival until well-balanced amino acid sources are found."

In particular, stress, fear, and anxiety have been linked to suppression of eating and anorexia nervosa. Here, we use a rodent model of an aversive cue-induced cessation of feeding. In this setting, food-deprived rats suppress eating when presented with a tone [conditioned stimulus (CS)] that was previously paired with footshocks [unconditioned stimulus (US)]. To begin to delineate the underlying neural circuitry we examined the two regions of the amygdala with well known roles in associative learning--the central nucleus (CEA) and the basolateral area (BLA; includes the basolateral, basomedial, and lateral nuclei). We produced selective, bilateral, neurotoxic lesions of the CEA or BLA, and then trained these rats together with sham-lesioned controls in a behavioral protocol that allowed a test for food consumption in the presence of an aversive CS. Both sham- and BLA-lesioned rats showed inhibition of eating when presented with the CS. In contrast, bilateral, neurotoxic lesions of the CEA abolished this effect. These results demonstrate that the CEA, but not BLA, is critical for control of feeding by an aversive CS. Previously we demonstrated that enhancement of eating by an appetitive CS is dependent on the integrity of BLA, but not CEA. Those findings together with the current results show a double dissociation between amygdalar subsystems that control food consumption by appetitive and aversive learned cues."

To search for mechanisms underlying this trait, a panel of mouse chromosome substitution strains derived from C57BL/6J and A/J strains was exposed to a scheduled feeding paradigm and to voluntary running wheel (RW) access. Here, we showed that A/J chromosomes 4, 12 and 13 contribute to the development of a disrupted RW activity in response to daily restricted feeding. This pattern is characterized by intense RW activity during the habitual rest phase and leads to accelerated body weight loss. Regions on mouse chromosomes 4, 12 and 13 display homology with regions on human chromosomes linked with anxiety and obsessionality in AN cohorts. Therefore, our data open new roads for interspecies genetic studies of AN and for unraveling novel mechanisms and potential effective treatment strategies for these neurobehavioral traits."

The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 4--Val108/158Met--is the most studied SNP at COMT and is the basis for most associations. It is not, however, the only variation in the gene; several haplotypes exist across the gene. Some studies indicate that the haplotypic combinations of alleles at the Val108/158Met SNP with those in the promoter region and in the 3'-untranslated region are responsible for the associations with disorders and not the non-synonymous SNP by itself. We have now studied DNA samples from 45 populations for 63 SNPs in a region of 172 kb across the region of 22q11.2 encompassing the COMT gene. We focused on 28 SNPs spanning the COMT-coding region and immediately flanking DNA, and found that the haplotypes are from diverse evolutionary lineages that could harbor as yet undetected variants with functional consequences.

Towards this goal, the hyponeophagia assay was implemented whereby food-deprived mice show increased latency to begin feeding in a novel, anxiogenic environment. The non-selective serotonin agonist, 5-MeODMT, potentiates feeding inhibition compared to the inhibition generated by the anxiogenic environment in a drug-by-environment interaction. Thus, using hyponeophagia in mice, it was possible to study the following key components of AN: anxiety; feeding inhibition; and a modulatory role of the serotonergic system. A major prediction of the proposed AN model is that 5-HT(1A) receptor activation is necessary for feeding inhibition. In support of this model, the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, WAY100635, reverses the 5-MeODMT-dependent potentiation of feeding inhibition. Our findings hint at a mechanistic role for increased 5-HT(1A) receptor activation in restricting-type AN. Further implications for the interplay between anxiety and feeding inhibition in AN are discussed."
"['Solomon MB', 'Jones K', 'Packard BA', 'Herman JP.']",The medial amygdala modulates body weight but not neuroendocrine responses to chronic stress.,J Neuroendocrinol,"Stress pathologies such as depression and eating disorders (i.e. anorexia nervosa) are associated with amygdalar dysfunction, which are linked with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis hyperactivity. The medial amygdaloid nucleus (MeA), a key output nucleus of the amygdaloid complex, promotes HPA axis activation to acute psychogenic stress and is in a prime position to mediate the deleterious effects of chronic stress on physiology and behaviour. The present study tests the hypothesis that the MeA is necessary for the development of maladaptive physiological changes caused by prolonged stress exposure. Male rats received bilateral ibotenate or sham lesions targeting the MeA and one half underwent 2 weeks of chronic variable stress (CVS) or served as home cage controls. Sixteen hours post CVS, all animals were exposed to an acute restraint challenge. CVS induced thymic involution, adrenal hypertrophy, and attenuated body weight gain and up-regulation of hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone mRNA expression. Consistent with previous literature, lesions of the MeA dampened stress-induced increases in corticosterone after 30 min of exposure to acute restraint stress. However, this effect was independent of CVS exposure, suggesting that the MeA may not be critical for modulating neuroendocrine responses after chronic HPA axis drive. Interestingly, lesion of the MeA modestly exaggerated the stress-induced attenuation of weight gain. Overall, the data obtained suggest that the MeA modulates the neuroendocrine responses to acute but not chronic stress. In addition, the data suggest that the MeA may be an important neural component for the control of body weight in the face of chronic stress."

"['Finger BC', 'Schellekens H', 'Dinan TG', 'Cryan JF.']",Is there altered sensitivity to ghrelin-receptor ligands in leptin-deficient mice?: importance of satiety state and time of day.,Psychopharmacology (Berl),"Background:
        
      
      Several fine-tuned and interconnected hypothalamic peptidergic systems orchestrate the regulation of energy homeostasis in the body. The orexigenic peptide ghrelin and the anorexigenic peptide leptin are among the most important, and both have been implicated in the development of eating disorders from obesity to anorexia nervosa.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The goal of these studies was to examine the response of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice in ghrelin-receptor ligands in a food intake task.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Changes in cumulative food intake were measured after peripheral administration of ghrelin (1 and 2 nmol/10 g) and the ghrelin-receptor antagonist (D-Lys(3))-GHRP-6 (66.6 and 133.3 nmol/10 g) in obese and lean control mice during the light and dark cycle as well as in a state of food restriction. Hypothalamic ghrelin and ghrelin-receptor expression was measured in ob/ob and lean mice at two different timepoints.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ghrelin increased food intake in lean and obese mice in the light and dark cycle, whereas the ghrelin-receptor antagonist caused significantly stronger reduction in food intake in obese mice only in the dark cycle. After fasting, ob/ob mice displayed decreased light cycle sensitivity to the anorexigenic effects of the ghrelin-receptor antagonist. Hypothalamic expression levels of ghrelin were unaltered during the light cycle but decreased during the dark cycle in ob/ob mice; whereas, although unchanged in the light cycle, ghrelin-receptor expression was increased in the dark cycle in obese mice.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The functionality and sensitivity of the ghrelinergic system is dependent on the time of day and the satiety state in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice."

In addition to their role in energy homeostasis, glucocorticoids have complex effects in the central nervous system, increasing the salience of activities such as wheel running. The objective of the present study was to analyze the role of corticosterone (cort) on wheel activity in food-restricted rats. Lewis rats were adrenalectomized and replaced with pellets containing increasing amounts of cort that caused different steady-state plasma concentrations from low to high HPA activity. They were given free access to a running wheel and were fed ad libitum or food-restricted. We also investigated the acute effect of cort injection mimicking the prefeeding cort peak on prefeeding wheel activity. Wheel running induced by food restriction was nearly non-existent in adrenalectomized food-restricted rats and increased in a dose-related manner with cort replacement. An acute stimulation of activity was also expressed during the preprandial peak of cort, suppressed by adrenalectomy and experimentally restored by acute cort injection. No such effects of cort were found in ad libitum fed rats. Our data demonstrate that food restriction-induced hyperactivity is critically and quantitatively dependent upon cort, not only on the mean basal levels of the hormone but also on the secretory peak that accompanies the burst of preprandial activity. The present results have special relevance for the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa and other compulsive behaviors."

Mice can be rendered ghrelin-deficient by knock-out of the gene encoding either ghrelin O-acyltransferase, which attaches the required octanoate, or ghrelin itself. Calorie-restricted, fat-depleted ghrelin O-acyltransferase or ghrelin knock-out mice fail to show the normal increase in growth hormone and become profoundly hypoglycemic when fasted for 18-23 h. Glucose production in Goat(-/-) mice was reduced by 60% when compared with similarly treated WT mice. Plasma lactate and pyruvate were also low. Injection of lactate, pyruvate, alanine, or a fatty acid restored blood glucose in Goat(-/-) mice. Thus, when body fat is reduced by calorie restriction, ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretion, which allows maintenance of glucose production, even when food intake is eliminated. In humans with anorexia nervosa or kwashiorkor, ghrelin and growth hormone are known to be elevated, just as they are in fat-depleted mice. We suggest that these two hormones prolong survival in starved humans as they do in mice."

Subsequent investigations aimed at elucidating the nature of the opioid-feeding relationship led to a wide variety of findings, some of them apparently contradictory. This paper examines the effects of opioid agonists and antagonists on feeding behaviour, and considers the evidence relating levels of endogenous opioids to feeding states, with particular reference to certain eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, Prader-Willi syndrome, and eating-induced obesity. The receptors which may be involved in opioid-feeding relationships are discussed. Relationships between the endogenous opioid system and other systems, such as the dopaminergic, noradrenergic and hormonal systems, are considered insofar as they may have bearing on the modulation of feeding behaviour. Finally, three theories are briefly outlined which attempt to link the endogenous opioid system with feeding modulation and the pathogenesis of certain eating disorders. The suggestion is put forward that anorexia nervosa may represent a pathological consequence of the triggering of a primitive mechanism for coping with unforeseen food shortages which may have short-term advantages, e.g., for masking or temporarily alleviating a depressed state."
"['Heymsfield SB', 'McManus CB.']",Tissue components of weight loss in cancer patients. A new method of study and preliminary observations.,Cancer,"A new approach using anthropometric, radiographic, biochemical, and ultrasonic methods allowed partition of body weight into fat, fat-free mass, skeletal muscle, and volume of heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, and tumor. These methods were used to evaluate body composition longitudinally in a pilot group of nine cancer patients, seven of whom lost weight (greater than 2.5 kg) during the study period. Two control groups also underwent the protocol: (1) healthy subjects (+/- 10% IBW) of similar age, sex, and height; and (2) patients with weight loss due to anorexia nervosa. Weight loss in both the cancer and anorexia nervosa groups could be accounted for primarily by loss in fat and skeletal muscle; although the relative magnitude of these tissue losses were approximately the same in both groups, cancer patients lost relatively less body weight. This was because (1) overt or occult ascites (detected radiographically) was present in cancer patients (3 of 9); (2) tumor bulk increased fat-free mass by up to 1 to 2 kg; and (3) the proportional loss in visceral organ volume was less in cancer patients than in anorexia nervosa patients. In the latter group, heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen were reduced in proportion to body weight, whereas in the cancer group as a whole, these organs (when uninvolved with tumor) lost little (heart and kidneys) or no volume (liver and spleen). This initial study suggests that the principal endogenous energy and nitrogen sources during evolution of weight loss in cancer are primarily adipose tissue triglycerides and skeletal muscle proteins. In some cancer patients, fluid accumulation, a large tumor burden, and the slow rate of visceral organ atrophy make body weight an unreliable index of available energy-nitrogen reserves."

Previous studies have found association of BDNF and NTRK2 to ED, while animal models suggest that other neurotrophin genes might also be involved in eating behavior. We have performed a family-based association study with 151 TagSNPs covering 10 neurotrophin signaling genes: NGFB, BDNF, NTRK1, NGFR/p75, NTF4/5, NTRK2, NTF3, NTRK3, CNTF and CNTFR in 371 ED trios of Spanish, French and German origin. Besides several nominal associations, we found a strong significant association after correcting for multiple testing (P = 1.04 x 10(-4)) between ED and rs7180942, located in the NTRK3 gene, which followed an overdominant model of inheritance. Interestingly, HapMap unrelated individuals carrying the rs7180942 risk genotypes for ED showed higher levels of expression of NTRK3 in lymphoblastoid cell lines. Furthermore, higher expression of the orthologous murine Ntrk3 gene was also detected in the hypothalamus of the anx/anx mouse model of anorexia. Finally, variants in NGFB gene appear to modify the risk conferred by the NTRK3 rs7180942 risk genotypes (P = 4.0 x 10(-5)) showing a synergistic epistatic interaction.

CRF overproduction has been implicated in affective disorders, such as depression and anorexia nervosa, and may lead to Cushing's syndrome. To test whether CRF overproduction leads to Cushing's syndrome and to develop an animal model of chronic pituitary-adrenal activation, the CRF gene was expressed under control of the metallothionein promoter in transgenic mice. CRF transgenic animals exhibit endocrine abnormalities involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, such as elevated plasma levels of ACTH and glucocorticoids. These animals display physical changes similar to those of patients with Cushing's syndrome, such as excess fat accumulation, muscle atrophy, thin skin, and alopecia. These findings indicate that chronic production of excess CRF results in sustained stimulation of pituitary corticotrope cells, resulting in elevated ACTH and consequent glucocorticoid overproduction, a condition that leads to the development of Cushing's syndrome. Analysis of CRF mRNA distribution revealed that transgene expression is primarily restricted to cells that express the endogenous CRF gene and does not follow the pattern predicted of a metallothionein-regulated gene. These results suggest that DNA elements located outside of the CRF promoter but present within the CRF intron, coding, or 3'-flanking regions may contribute to the cell type specificity of CRF gene expression."

We conclude that dietary restriction causes profound changes in gastric emptying by unknown mechanisms which may be operating in patients with anorexia nervosa."
"['Filteau SM', 'Menzies RA', 'Kaido TJ', ""O'Grady MP"", 'Gelderd JB', 'Hall NR.']",Effects of exercise on immune functions of undernourished mice.,Life Sci,"Regular moderate exercise may modulate the response to a stressor and thus improve immune functions in conditions commonly associated with immunodepression and elevated levels of stress hormones. For example, anorexia nervosa patients, many of whom engage in regular aerobic exercise, generally have normal immune function and viral disease resistance in spite of their severe undernutrition. To test the hypothesis that exercise can prevent undernutrition-induced immunodepression, mice were fed a nutritionally complete, semi-purified diet, either ad libitum or in restricted quantities to induce 25% loss of initial weight over 3 weeks. Half the animals from each dietary group were run on a treadmill for 30 min/day, 5 days/week. Exercise had no effect on several measures of nutritional status. Spleen weight and blastogenic response to lipopolysaccharide were significantly increased by exercise in undernourished mice. In vivo antibody response to sheep red blood cells, and in vitro splenic responses to concanavalin A and phytohemagglutin were not significantly affected by exercise. Serum corticosterone level was increased by food restriction and significantly decreased by exercise in the undernourished mice. Within a treatment group there were no significant correlations between serum corticosterone level and any immune system measure. Hypothalamic concentration of uric acid was increased in food restriction groups and concentration of norepinephrine was increased in exercise groups. The results suggest that regular exercise may help prevent undernutrition-induced immunodepression, possibly through modulation of the stress response."

To elucidate the physiological basis of sex differences in responses to energy intake, we maintained groups of male and female rats for 6 months on diets with usual, reduced [20% and 40% caloric restriction (CR), and intermittent fasting (IF)], or elevated (high-fat/high-glucose) energy levels and measured multiple physiological variables related to reproduction, energy metabolism, and behavior. In response to 40% CR, females became emaciated, ceased cycling, underwent endocrine masculinization, exhibited a heightened stress response, increased their spontaneous activity, improved their learning and memory, and maintained elevated levels of circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor. In contrast, males on 40% CR maintained a higher body weight than the 40% CR females and did not change their activity levels as significantly as the 40% CR females. Additionally, there was no significant change in the cognitive ability of the males on the 40% CR diet. Males and females exhibited similar responses of circulating lipids (cholesterols/triglycerides) and energy-regulating hormones (insulin, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin) to energy restriction, with the changes being quantitatively greater in males. The high-fat/high-glucose diet had no significant effects on most variables measured but adversely affected the reproductive cycle in females. Heightened cognition and motor activity, combined with reproductive shutdown, in females may maximize the probability of their survival during periods of energy scarcity and may be an evolutionary basis for the vulnerability of women to anorexia nervosa."

However, in spite of its potential use in a broad spectrum of disorders, the mechanisms of action of DBS remain largely unclear and optimal neural targets for stimulation in several disorders have yet to be established. Thus, there is a great need to examine site-specific effects of DBS on a behavioural level and to understand how DBS may modulate pathological behaviour. In view of the possible application of DBS in the treatment of disorders characterized by impaired processing of reward and motivation, like addiction and eating disorders, we examined the effect of DBS of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) on food-directed behavior. Rats were implanted with bilateral stimulation electrodes in one of three anatomically and functionally distinct sub-areas of the NAcc: the core, lateral shell (lShell) and medial shell (mShell). Subsequently, we studied the effects of DBS on food consumption, and the motivational and appetitive properties of food. The data revealed a functional dissociation between the lShell and mShell. DBS of the lShell reduced motivation to respond for sucrose under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, mShell DBS, however, profoundly and selectively increased the intake of chow. DBS of the NAcc core did not alter any form of food-directed behavior studied. DBS of neither structure affected sucrose preference. These data indicate that the intake of chow and the motivation to work for palatable food can independently be modulated by DBS of subregions of the NAcc shell. As such, these findings provide important leads for the possible future application of DBS as a treatment for eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa."

To induce it, food-restricted rats are confined in running wheels except during the daily meal. We tested whether activity in a flat circular alley also produces the activity anorexia syndrome. In Experiment 1, food-restricted rats were maintained in alleys, wheels, or home cages (control condition). In Experiment 2, they were maintained in alleys, wheels, novel cages, or home cages. The novel cage was added to control for the possibility that the alley might produce an anorectic effect simply because it was a new living space. The alley did not produce the activity anorexia syndrome whereas the wheel did. Although weight loss was greater in the alley than home-cage condition, the alley produced weak, inconsistent suppression of feeding. Moreover, the suppression produced by the alley may have stemmed simply from living in a novel environment. Finally, in contrast to wheel running, alley activity decreased over days. Alley activity, unlike wheel running, may not be reinforcing. Likely, a physical activity must be reinforcing to produce the activity anorexia syndrome. Implications for anorexia nervosa were discussed."
['Casper RC.'],How useful are pharmacological treatments in eating disorders?,Psychopharmacol Bull,"The eating disorders anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are multifactorial syndromes of unknown origin which occur typically in female adolescents or young women. Nowadays, AN and BN are most often triggered by dietary restriction. Both are treatable conditions. As in other psychiatric disorders, a lower comorbidity, a shorter duration of illness, less familial psychopathology, and, in AN, a higher minimal weight have been shown to be associated with a better outcome. So far, no abnormalities specific to AN or BN that would shed light on their etiology have been identified. Controlled and uncontrolled studies testing antipsychotic, antidepressant, weight-promoting, and prokinetic drugs have demonstrated that the core symptoms of AN are refractory to currently available psychotropic medication. For relapse prevention, however, antidepressant medication may be useful. Renutrition, psychotherapy, and family therapy remain the cornerstones of treatment for AN. Placebo-controlled studies with antidepressant drugs have been far more promising for treating BN in the short term. Recent studies have found that lasting symptomatic improvement and remission require the addition of psychological treatments in the form of cognitive and interpersonal psychotherapy. The steady stream of newly identified peptides and other molecules involved in appetite and body weight control may ultimately provide cues to better targeted treatments of eating disorders."
['Simansky KJ.'],"NIH symposium series: ingestive mechanisms in obesity, substance abuse and mental disorders.",Physiol Behav,"This report summarizes the background and specific objectives for a symposium on the neurobiology of nonhomeostatic eating and drug abuse that was held at the 2004 Annual Meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior (SSIB). The symposium was the first of a series funded by a conference grant from four institutes of the National Institutes of Health. The encompassing goal of the series is to analyze the roles for the biological mechanisms of ingestion in obesity, eating disorders and other theoretically related areas including addiction, depression and schizophrenia. The symptoms and treatments of these diverse pathologies routinely involve aberrations in the mechanisms regulating eating and body weight. The presentations and discussion from this symposium (1) identified changes in neurotransmitter dynamics and gene expression in brain ""reward circuits"" accompanying learning of behaviors to obtain palatable foods or drugs of abuse; (2) analyzed behavioral findings in animals and humans, and neuroimaging data in humans, supporting treatment with GABA(B) agonists to reduce craving for drugs of abuse and possibly for highly rewarding foods; and (3) used neuroimaging data in humans to establish novel serotonergic targets for normalizing reward processes and impulse control in anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Overall, the symposium clearly revealed our rapidly broadening understanding of the alterations in the brain at the molecular, cellular and systems levels that are associated with craving and nonhomeostatic consumption of food and drugs of abuse. This knowledge gained largely in animal models translates to novel and better strategies for treating human patients."

There are three receptors, CRF1, CRF2 alpha and CRF2 beta, which encode 411, 415 and 431 amino acid proteins and transduce signals via the stimulation of intracellular cAMP production. The recent identification of high-affinity non-peptide CRF receptor antagonists should allow for rapid progress in drug development of CRF receptor antagonists. In addition to the receptors, the actions of CRF in brain and in the periphery can also be modulated by a binding protein of 322 amino acids. Ligands of CRF-BP, such as CRF (6-33) can elevate brain levels of 'free' CRF and improve learning and memory without stress-like side effects of CRF receptor agonists. Urocortin, a mammalian CRF-related peptide with close sequence homology to fish urotensin, interacts with CRF1, CRF2 receptors and with CRF-BP. These data indicate that CRF receptor antagonists may be useful for the treatment of the disease states where CRF is elevated such as anxiety and depression, anorexia nervosa and stroke and that ligand inhibitors of CRF-BP may be used to elevate brain levels of 'free' urocortin and other CRF-related peptides."

It seems paradoxical to treat a disorder characterized by reduced food intake with appetite suppressants. The effects of the indirect-acting 5-HT agonist D-fenfluramine on activity-based anorexia (ABA) were investigated, coincident with ABA (experiment 1), and after tolerance and weight cycling (experiment 2). Rats were chronically infused with D-fenfluramine by using subcutaneous mini-pumps and then tested for susceptibility to ABA (22.5 h free running wheel access, 1.5 h access to food). Concurrent D-fenfluramine increased the risk of ABA by decreasing food consumption. Conversely, D-fenfluramine reduced the incidence of ABA in tolerant rats with a history of weight cycling. Therefore, the effects of D-fenfluramine depend on whether drug administration coincides with ABA or whether tolerance and weight cycling precede ABA onset. The results were related to the metabolic effects of weight cycling and the treatment of anorexia nervosa."
"['Scott EC', 'Johnston FE.']","Critical fat, menarche, and the maintenance of menstrual cycles: a critical review.",J Adolesc Health Care,"The critical weight (fat) hypothesis has generated interest as a mechanism for the onset and maintenance of normal reproductive cycles in human females. It postulates that menarche is triggered by the attainment of a critical percentage fat and that the maintenance of menstrual cycles requires the persistence of a minimal level; each level is argued to be universal for a particular population or race and, by implication, for the species as a whole. However, an examination of the evidence reveals the hypothesis to have a number of serious methodological and empirical shortcomings which may be grouped under three headings. First, there are no acceptable measures of body fatness, and workers rely instead on estimates from height and weight which have been shown to be intolerably erroneous for individuals. Second, using either these estimates, or more reliable ones using appropriate methods, it may be shown that critical levels do not apply: numerous exceptions involving fat levels above and below the suggested threshold may be shown. Finally, where specific conditions involving reduced fatness and menstrual delay or dysfunction are used to support the hypothesis, it may be shown that other confounding factors are equally plausible. Consequently, based on available evidence, the critical weight (fat) hypothesis cannot be accepted. Hypotheses based on normal maturational processes, especially of the central nervous system, currently provide better explanations."

On other occasions, these rats while hungry and thirsty were exposed to the alternate solution without wheel running. Conditioned aversion to the flavor paired with wheel running was evident after two pairings. During final tests with each solution, the rats were thirsty but not hungry. As expected, conditioned aversion to the particular flavor paired with wheel running was still observed despite a change in deprivation state from training to test. These results indicate that wheel running can induce sickness. Because sickness suppresses eating, activity anorexia in rats and some forms of anorexia nervosa in humans may be caused, at least in part, by sickness."

This report shows that both TRH and AP reduce dose-dependently the food intake during sham-feeding and inhibit gastric and pancreatic secretions in response to various exogenous and endogenous stimulants in conscious dogs. The results indicate that TRH and AP have similar inhibitory action on feeding and gastrointestinal secretory activity and that they may be involved in peptidergic mediation of satiety and gastrointestinal secretion."

We showed that after a long-term energy deficit, mice exhibited persistent hypoleptinemia following the refeeding period despite restoration of fat mass, ovarian activity, and feeding behavior. We aimed to examine the hypothalamic adaptations after 10 weeks of energy deficit and after 10 further weeks of nutritional recovery. To do so, we assessed the mRNA levels of the leptin receptor and the main orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides, and their receptors regulated by leptin. Markers of hypothalamic inflammation were assessed as leptin can also participate in this phenomenon. Long-term time-restricted feeding and separation induced significant increase in mRNA levels of hypothalamic orexigenic peptides, while both Y1 and Y5 receptor mRNAs were downregulated. No changes occurred in the mRNA levels of orexin (OX), melanin-concentrating hormone, pro-opiomelanocortin, 26RFa (26-amino acid RF-amide peptide), and their receptors despite an increase in the expression of melanocortin receptors (MC3-R and MC4-R) and OXR1 (OX receptor 1). The refeeding period induced an overexpression of leptin receptor mRNA in the hypothalamus. The other assessed mRNA levels were normalized except for Y2, Y5, MC3-R, and MC4-R, which remained upregulated. No convincing changes were observed in neuroinflammatory markers, even if interleukin-1β mRNA levels were increased in parallel with those of Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1), a marker of microglial activation. Normalization of leptin-regulated functions and hypothalamic gene expressions in refed mice with low plasma leptin levels could be sustained by recalibration of hypothalamic sensitivity to leptin."

      While eating disorders (EDs) are thought to result from a combination of environmental and psychological stressors superimposed on genetic vulnerability, the neurobiological basis of EDs remains incompletely understood. We recently reported that a rare missense mutation in the gene for the transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is associated with the risk of developing an ED in humans.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To understand the biological consequences of this missense mutation, we created transgenic mice carrying this mutation by introducing the alanine to threonine mutation at position 778 of mouse Hdac4 (corresponding to position 786 of the human protein). Bioinformatic analysis to identify Hdac4-regulated genes was performed using available databases.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Male mice heterozygous for HDAC4A778T did not show any metabolic or behavioral differences. In contrast, female mice heterozygous for HDAC4A778T display several ED-related feeding and behavioral deficits depending on housing condition. Individually housed HDAC4A778T female mice exhibit reduced effortful responding for high-fat diet and compulsive grooming, whereas group-housed female mice display increased weight gain on high-fat diet, reduced behavioral despair, and increased anxiety-like behaviors. Bioinformatic analysis identifies mitochondrial biogenesis including synthesis of glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid as a potential transcriptional target of HDAC4A778T activity relevant to the behavioral deficits identified in this new mouse model of disordered eating.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The HDAC4A778T mouse line is a novel model of ED-related behaviors and identifies mitochondrial biogenesis as a potential molecular pathway contributing to behavioral deficits."

We have identified a novel SK3 transcript, SK3-1B that utilizes an alternative first exon (exon 1B), but is otherwise identical to SK3. SK3-1B, mRNA is widely distributed in human tissues and is present at 20-60% of SK3 in the brain. The SK3-1B protein lacks the N-terminus and first transmembrane segment, and begins eight residues upstream of the second transmembrane segment. When expressed alone, SK3-1B did not produce functional channels, but selectively suppressed endogenous SK3 currents in the pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, in a dominant-negative fashion. This dominant inhibitory effect extended to other members of the SK subfamily, but not to voltage-gated K(+) channels, and appears to be due to intracellular trapping of endogenous SK channels. The effect of SK3-1B expression is very similar to that produced by expression of the rare SK3 truncation allele, SK3-Delta, found in a patient with schizophrenia. Regulation of SK3 and SK3-1B levels may provide a potent mechanism to titrate neuronal firing rates and neurotransmitter release in monoaminergic neurons, and alterations in the relative abundance of these proteins could contribute to abnormal neuronal excitability, and to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."

Because undernutrition is often associated with a suppressed reproductive axis, we have postulated that increasing peripheral ghrelin levels will decrease the activity of the GnRH pulse generator. Adult ovariectomized rhesus monkeys (n = 6) were subjected to a 5-h iv human ghrelin (100- to 150-microg bolus followed by 100-150 microg/h) or saline infusion, preceded by a 3-h saline infusion to establish baseline pulsatile LH release. Blood samples were collected at 15-min intervals throughout the experiment. Ghrelin infusion increased plasma ghrelin levels 2.9-fold of baseline. Ghrelin significantly decreased LH pulse frequency (from 0.89 +/- 0.07/h in baseline to 0.57 +/- 0.10/h during ghrelin infusion; P < 0.05, mean +/- sem), whereas LH pulse frequency remained unchanged during saline treatment. LH pulse amplitude was not affected. Ghrelin also significantly stimulated both cortisol and GH release, but had no effect on leptin. We conclude that ghrelin can inhibit GnRH pulse activity and may thereby mediate the suppression of the reproductive system observed in conditions of undernutrition, such as in anorexia nervosa. Ghrelin also activates the adrenal axis, but the relevance of this to the inhibition of GnRH pulse frequency remains to be established."
['Boakes RA.'],Self-starvation in the rat: running versus eating.,Span J Psychol,"Rats given the combination of unrestricted access to an activity wheel and restricted access to food can lose weight to the extent that they will die unless removed from these conditions. Although this has been known for forty years, why this happens has remained unclear. The phenomenon is paradoxical in that one might expect such rats to eat more as their weight decreases, but in fact they eat less than resting controls. This lecture first examines some of the factors than influence whether self-starvation will occur, such as age, time of food access, type of food and ambient temperature. It then compares competing explanations such as circadian adaptation, thermo-regulation and food aversion learning. As so often in psychology, it turns out that self-starvation results from a combination of many separate factors. The general implications of this research are examined, including whether it provides a useful animal model for human anorexia nervosa."

      We evaluated the effect of food restriction (FR) on the various reflexes involved in short term cardiovascular regulation; we also evaluated the contribution of the sympathetic nervous systemand of the plasmatic nitric oxide (NO) in the development of the counterregulatory cardiovascular changes triggered by FR.
    


          Main methods:
        
      
      Female rats were subjected to FR for 14 days, and after this period biochemical measurements of biochemical parameters were performed. For physiological tests, animals were anaesthetised, and a catheter was inserted into the femoral artery and vein for the acquisition of blood pressure and heart hate, and drug infusion, respectively.We then tested the Bezold–Jarisch reflex, the baroreflex and chemoreflex and the effect of the infusion of adrenergic receptor antagonists in control and food restricted animals.
    


          Key findings:
        
      
      The rats subjected to severe FR presented biochemical changes characteristic of malnutrition with a great catabolic state. FR also led to hypotension and bradycardia besides reducing the plasmatic concentration of NO. Moreover, activation of the Bezold–Jarisch reflex induced a more pronounced hypotensive response in animals subjected to FR. Intravenous infusion of a α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist induced a greater hypotensive response and a more pronounced tachycardic response in animals under food restriction,while the infusion of β-adrenoreceptor antagonist induced lower increases in blood pressure in these animals.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      Our results suggest that an increased α1-adrenoreceptor activity in the resistance arteries coupled with a reduction of plasmatic NO contributes in a complementary manner to maintain the blood pressure levels in animals under FR."

      We have recently shown that intranasal administration of mouse [d-Leu-4]-OB3 reconstituted in Intravail to male Swiss Webster mice resulted in significantly higher bioavailability than commonly used injections methods of delivery. The absorption profile associated with intranasal delivery of mouse [d-Leu-4]-OB3 showed an early peak representing absorption across the nasal mucosa, and a later peak suggesting a gastrointestinal site of uptake.
    


          Aim and methods:
        
      
      In the present study, we examined the effects of orally administered (by gavage) mouse [d-Leu-4]-OB3 on energy balance, glycaemic control and serum osteocalcin levels in male C57BL/6J wild-type and ob/ob mice allowed food and water ad libitum or calorie restricted by 40% of normal intake.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In wild-type mice fed ad libitum, oral delivery of mouse [d-Leu-4]-OB3 reduced body weight gain, food intake and serum glucose, by 4.4, 6.8 and 28.2% respectively. Serum osteocalcin levels and water intake were essentially the same in control and treated wild-type mice. In ob/ob mice fed ad libitum, mouse [d-Leu-4]-OB3 reduced body weight gain, food intake, water intake and serum glucose by 11.6, 16.5, 22.4 and 24.4% respectively. Serum osteocalcin in ob/ob mice treated with mouse [d-Leu-4]-OB3 was elevated by 62% over controls. Calorie restriction alone caused significant weight loss in both wild-type (9.0%) and ob/ob (4.8%) mice, and mouse [d-Leu-4]-OB3 did not further enhance this weight loss. As expected, serum glucose levels in wild-type and ob/ob mice were significantly reduced by calorie restriction alone. Mouse [d-Leu-4]-OB3 further reduced serum glucose in wild-type mice and normalized levels in ob/ob mice. Calorie restriction alone reduced serum osteocalcin levels by 44.2% in wild-type mice and by 19.1% in ob/ob mice. Mouse [d-Leu-4]-OB3 prevented this decrease in groups of mice.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results of this study suggest that oral delivery of mouse [d-Leu-4]-OB3 in Intravail is possible and may have potential not only as an alternative therapy in the treatment of human obesity and some of its associated metabolic dysfunctions, but also may help to prevent and/or reverse at least some of the bone loss which accompanies osteoporosis, anorexia nervosa and other wasting diseases."

      In the hypomagnesic dermatosis of rats, low-dietary magnesium leads to lowered serum Mg2+, universal dermatitis and scratching. The model is postulated to work better if the diet also has a low content of lipids. Pruritus is seen in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa and resolves on weight restoration. Lipid depletion of the diet and/or lowered body weight may therefore be important in developing pruritus. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether a diet low in lipids can induce pruritus in dermatitis prone rats because of mild magnesium depletion thereby focusing on the role of lipids in the hypomagnesic dermatosis rat model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fourteen male hairless rats, 3 weeks of age, were fed a diet deficient in lipids and with a lower content of magnesium for a 4-week period and compared with 11 controls fed a normal diet. The skin was inspected daily and transepidermal water loss (TEWL), serum Mg2+ and scratching activity were measured. At the end, skin biopsies were taken from the flank and ears.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Serum Mg2+ was significantly lowered in the diet group (P<0.001) but the rats developed no dermatitis or increased TEWL compared with 11 rats in a control group. Biopsies were normal with no sign of inflammation. Rats in the diet group had inferior weight gain, were less active and spent more time asleep than control rats (P<0.01). Furthermore, scratching activity monitored in the last week of the study as the number of scratch-sequences per awake minute was reduced in the diet group (P<0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The lipid-deficient diet was not able to induce pruritic dermatitis despite the fact that the rats were dermatitis prone because of mild magnesium depletion. It is not confirmed that dietary lipid depletion plays any significant role in the hypomagnesic dermatitis rat model. The dermatitis and the model appear to be strictly dependent on efficient magnesium depletion manufactured with very low magnesium levels."

We hypothesized that caloric restriction and stress interact in a unique manner to promote binge eating. To test this hypothesis, a group of young female rats were cycled through a restriction period (4 days of 66% of control food intake) followed by 6 days of free feeding prior to being stressed by acute foot shock. After three of these cycles, the food intake of rats exposed only to restriction (R), or only to stress (S), did not differ from controls. However, R+S rats that were restricted and refed, despite normal body weight and food intake after free feeding, engaged in a powerful bout of hyperphagia when stressed (Experiment 1). The R + S effect was replicated in an older group of rats (Experiment 2). The hyperphagia was characteristically binge-like, it constituted a 40% selective increase in highly palatable (HP) food (P < .001) over a discrete period of time (within 24 h post-stress), and reflected feeding for reward (higher HP:chow ratio) over metabolic need as occurred after restriction (higher chow:HP ratio). Subsequent experiments revealed that binge eating did not occur if only chow was available (Experiment 3) or if restriction-refeeding (R-R) did not proximally precede stress (Experiment 4). Experiment 5 revealed that a history of R-R cycles followed by only one stress episode was sufficient to increase intake to 53% above controls as early as 2 h after stress (P < .001). This animal model of binge eating should facilitate investigations into the neurochemical changes induced by dieting and environmental stress to produce disordered eating and provide a preclinical tool to test preventive strategies and treatments more relevant to bulimia nervosa, multiple cases of binge eating disorder (BED) and binge-purge type anorexia nervosa."

      The biological background of sex-related differences in the development of eating disorders (EDs) is unknown. Recent data showed that gut bacteria Escherichia coli induce autoantibodies against anorexigenic α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) associated with psychopathology in ED. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of E. coli on feeding and autoantibodies against α-MSH and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), between female and male rats.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Commensal E. coli K12 were given in a culture medium daily to adult Wistar rats by intragastric gavage over a 3-wk period; control rats received culture medium only.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Before gavage, E. coli K12 DNA was detected in feces of female but not male rats. E. coli provision was accompanied by an increase in body weight gain in females, but a decrease in body weight gain and food intake in males. Independent of E. coli treatment, plasma levels of anti-α-MSH and ACTH immunoglobulin (Ig)G were higher in female than male rats. Females responded to E. coli by increasing α-MSH IgG levels and affinity, but males by increasing α-MSH IgM levels. Affinity of IgG for ACTH was increased in both E. coli-treated females and males, although with different kinetics. IgG from females stimulated more efficiently α-MSH-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate production by melanocortin 4 receptor-expressing cells compared with IgG from males.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Sex-related response to how E. coli affects feeding and anti-melanocortin hormone antibody production may depend on the presence of these bacteria in the gut before E. coli supplementation. These data suggest that sex-related presence of certain gut bacteria may represent a risk factor for ED development."

This is a report of gelatinous marrow transformation and hematopoietic marrow atrophy in a 5-year-old miniature horse stallion. The horse had oral malformations leading to poor food assimilation and emaciation. A bone marrow biopsy obtained to investigate persistent anemia and leukopenia showed hematopoietic atrophy and replacement of fat with a granular extracellular substance, which stained with alcian blue, consistent with acidic mucopolysaccharide content. Surgical correction of the dental abnormalities resulted in improved food assimilation, weight gain, and resolution of cytopenias. In humans, gelatinous bone marrow transformation and hematopoietic atrophy are commonly associated with malnutrition from anorexia nervosa and other causes. The cause of hematopoietic atrophy is unknown but may relate to a nonsupportive marrow microenvironment and inadequate hematopoietic substrate availability. Similar pathogenic mechanisms were suspected in this horse."

However, the effects on food intake of repeated injections of CRH or repeated exposures to restraint stress have not been previously reported. As the effects of these more chronic CRH and stress treatments may be of greater relevance to emerging hypotheses of the pathogenesis of human eating and affective disorders, we measured the changes in food intake and body weight of rats after repeated central injections of CRH. In two experiments using two different daily dosages of CRH and two different schedules of administration, we found that the anorectic effect of CRH decreased over repeated injections. Weight gain was slowed significantly only in the high-dose experiment. Rats may become tolerant to the anorectic effects of CRH delivered by repeated icv injections. These findings have important implications for hypothesized mechanisms of anorexia nervosa and/or depression."

RF decreased plasma tryptophan concentration in RF starved and RF fed females and also in RF starved males.

Food restriction decreased 5-HT concentration in the rest of the brain of male but not female rats. Possible implications of the findings in the pathogenesis of food restriction/starvation related disease anorexia nervosa and its greater occurrence in women than men is discussed."

Young female mice were fed to 100, 60, and 40% of the calculated daily nutritional requirements for a period of up to 18 days. Cognitive function was evaluated using a modified eight-arm maze with water as a reward. Animals fed to 60% of controls showed significantly improved maze performance while this was impaired in animals on DR to 40%. However, in these animals, injections of tyrosine (100 mg/kg/day) restored performance. Improved maze performance in the 60% DR and 40% DR + tyrosine animals was related to increased beta:alpha tone in the hippocampus- an area, together with the septum, responsible for spatial learning. This was associated with changes in alpha- and beta-receptor density (Bmax), without affecting affinity (Kd); and increased norepinephrine (NE) in the 40% DR + tyrosine group, and methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in both groups. In the hypothalamus, the brain area responsible for energy metabolism, there was a progressive increase in alpha:beta tone with increasing DR associated with changes in Bmax. Tyrosine treatment reversed these alterations. Tyrosine improves some of the neurobiological disturbances of DR without causing an increase in body weight. Such a strategy might have important implications for the possible treatment of patients with anorexia nervosa."

Analysis of the role of CRH in regulation of the HPA axis would be facilitated by the creation of animal models in which CRH gene structure and function could be manipulated. We have determined the DNA sequence of the mouse CRH gene. Using a highly sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method, we have found expression of CRH mRNA in adrenal, ovary, testis, gut, heart, anterior pituitary, lung, and spleen, in addition to cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. Within the spleen, CRH mRNA is localized specifically to T-lymphocytes. We mapped the chromosomal location of mouse CRH via interspecific mouse backcrosses to chromosome 3, which is not the site of any naturally occurring mutations consistent with CRH deficiency. Because of this, we inactivated a CRH allele in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by homologous recombination with a mutant mouse CRH gene lacking the entire coding region of preproCRH. Mice chimeric for each of two ES clones with an inactivated CRH allele are being used to generate animals with complete CRH deficiency."

Because such adiposity was thought to be mediated by hypothalamic NPY neurons, we investigated by which mechanism a synthetic ghrelin receptor agonist, GHRP-2, would generate a positive energy balance in NPY-deficient [Npy(-/-) mice] and wild-type controls. A dose-dependent increase in body weight and food intake was observed during daily sc injections with GHRP-2. Pre- and posttreatment analysis of body composition indicated increased fat mass and bone mass but not lean mass. Respiratory quotient was increased in GHRP-2-treated mice, indicating preservation of fat. Hypothalamic mRNA levels of agouti- related protein (AGRP), an orexigenic melanocortin receptor antagonist, increased after GHRP-2 treatment. Competitive blockade of AGRP action by melanocortin-receptor agonist MT-II prevented GHRP-induced weight gain in Npy(-/-) mice. In conclusion, chronic peripheral treatment with a ghrelin receptor agonist induced a positive energy balance leading to fat gain in the absence of NPY. These effects could be mediated in part by AGRP. To date, there are few therapeutics that can produce a positive energy balance. Ghrelin receptor agonists offer a treatment option for syndromes like anorexia nervosa, cancer cachexia, or AIDS wasting."

With the discovery of peptides related to hypothalamic control of food intake (e.g. leptin and ghrelin) the search for the biological 'master key' of feeding control was renewed. As a result, mid-20th century biological concepts based on systematic and cybernetic thoughts fell into oblivion. This review highlights discoveries of hypothalamic-controlled feeding and eating behavior with a cybernetic and systematic perspective. Interestingly, older ideas of hypothalamic function offer possibilities for the incorporation of new molecular discoveries into systematic concepts of feeding behavior."

Serum amylase activity decreased significantly in 31 of 34 normal subjects 60 to 120 min after administration of TRH. However, amylase isoenzymes were not significantly affected after administration of TRH, suggesting that TRH equally affects pancreatic and salivary amylase activity. TRH was also effective in patients on chronic hemodialysis, indicating that TRH does not reduce serum amylase activity by increasing urinary excretion of amylase. Since TRH reduced serum amylase activity in hyperthyroid patients in whom TRH failed to stimulate TSH secretion, TRH does not reduce serum amylase activity through increased secretion of TSH. The action of TRH was not mediated by serum thyroid hormone levels since TRH was similarly effective in patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. TRH did not inhibit or interfere with amylase determination when added in vitro to heparinized blood. Perfusion of the dog pancreas with TRH reduced amylase activity in pancreatic juice and pancreatic venous blood. The magnitude of the decrease was related to the dose of TRH used. Since decrease in amylase activity of the pancreatic juice preceded that in pancreatic venous blood, TRH probably directly acts on the pancreas to reduce amylase secretion. As a result, serum amylase activity decreased after administration of TRH."

Separation decreased body weight in mice (P < .001) and spontaneous alternations in the T-maze (P < .001). This impairment was associated with depletion of both norepinephrine (NE, P < .001) and dopamine (P < .01) while increasing MHPG (P < .05) and the ratio of MHPG/NE (P < .05). Increasing tyrosine availability restored performance to control levels (P < .001) and repleted dopamine (P < .05) and presumably also NE (indicated by increases in both MHPG, P < .001, and MHPG/NE, P < .05). Stress increased adrenergic alpha(2)-receptor density (P < .001) without changing its K(d) and the B(max) and K(d) of beta-receptors, suggesting that it decreased NE transmission through action on alpha(2)-receptors. The balance between beta- and alpha(2)-receptors appeared to be related to alternation behavior as shown by the decrease (P < .01) and increase (P < .05) in their ratios induced by stress and tyrosine, respectively. With regard to cholinergic tone, separation stress increased M1 receptor density (P < .05) and its mRNA signal (P < .001). Tyrosine further increased M1 receptor density of stressed mice (P < .05). Tyrosine might be a potential therapy for cognitive and mood problems associated with the maintenance of a reduced body weight in the treatment of obesity and in the extreme case of anorexia nervosa."

Specifically, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity was evaluated as a function of gender and social status in four consecutive social environments [(1) stable heterosexual pairs; (2) isolation; (3) unstable peer groups; and (4) stable peer groups], by measuring both basal plasma cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-endorphin concentrations and responsiveness of these hormones to dexamethasone, ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (oCRH), and ACTH1-24. Socially stressful conditions, such as isolation and peer group formation, were associated with increased HPA axis function and behavioral arousal, and individual profiles were related to gender and social status. Hormonal levels prior to group formation predicted subsequent status in peer groups. Basal morning concentrations of plasma cortisol, as well as cortisol responsiveness to dexamethasone suppression, were sensitive indices of HPA axis arousal during periods of social stress. The context-dependent development of hormonal and behavioral profiles, reminiscent of depression and/or anorexia nervosa, suggests that the common marmoset may be a useful model of psychiatric hypercortisolism."

To address these questions, dynamics of dopamine release were measured in 15 min microdialysis samples simultaneously from the LHA and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) during consecutive exposure and provision of food and 1% sucrose in Wistar rats after overnight food deprivation. α-MSH was infused via the microdialysis probe either into the LHA or NAc starting before food exposure. Food, sucrose and water intakes were automatically monitored and analyzed concomitantly with microdialysis samples. We found that LHA-α-MSH-infused rats stopped eating earlier and consumed less food and sucrose as compared to control and NAc-α-MSH-infused rats. Exposure to food produced a peak of LHA dopamine in both LHA-α-MSH and NAc-α-MSH-infused rats but not in the controls. During food provision, LHA dopamine levels were strongly elevated in LHA-α-MSH infused rats, while delivery of α-MSH into the NAc induced a less intense increase of dopamine in both NAc and LHA. In all rats, LHA dopamine levels correlated inversely with sucrose intake. In conclusion, our study showed that α-MSH stimulates dopamine release in the LHA during both the anticipatory and consummatory phases of feeding, decreases food intake and inhibits sucrose intake. These data suggest that LHA dopamine release can be involved in α-MSH anorexigenic effects."

In addition to its endocrine functions, CRF acts as a neuromodulator in extra-hypothalamic systems and has been shown to play a role in behavioral responses to stress. CRF overproduction has been implicated in affective disorders such as depression and anorexia nervosa. A transgenic mouse model of CRF overproduction has been developed in order to examine the endocrine and behavioral effects of chronic CRF excess. CRF transgenic animals exhibit endocrine abnormalities involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis such as elevated plasma levels of ACTH and glucocorticoids. The present series of experiments tested the hypothesis that chronic overproduction of CRF throughout the life-span of these animals may lead to an anxiogenic behavioral state. CRF transgenic mice and normal littermate controls were tested by measuring locomotor activity in a novel environment and through the use of an elevated plus-maze as indices of anxiety. CRF transgenic animals exhibited an increase in anxiogenic behavior, an effect known to occur following central administration of CRF in mice and rats. Injection of the CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF 9-41 into the lateral cerebral ventricles reversed the anxiogenic state observed in the CRF transgenics. This finding supports the possibility that central CRF overproduction may mediate the anxiogenic behavior exhibited in this animal model. Thus, CRF transgenic mice represent a genetic model of CRF overproduction that provides a valuable tool for investigating the long-term effects of CRF excess and dysregulation in the CNS."

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of selective inactivation of hypothalamic CRF neurons on food intake induced by NPY injection and to delineate which hypothalamic nucleus is involved in this NPY/CRF interaction related to the regulation of food intake. Impairment of CRF neuron function by immunotargeting of a ricin A chain toxin with a monoclonal antibody to CRF (CRF-MAb) has been previously reported. Administration of CRF-MAb/toxins into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) two weeks prior to testing produced markedly enhanced eating induced by injection of NPY into the same nucleus. This effect was accompanied by a 60% decrease in CRF content within the hypothalamus and a 43% decrease of CRF in the median eminence, a site of projection of CRF neurons from the PVN. In contrast, injection of CRF-MAb/toxins into the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) did not modify the feeding induced by NPY injection into this hypothalamic area. Systemic pretreatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone at a dose known to downregulate the levels of CRF in the PVN also enhanced the feeding induced by intra-PVN injection of NPY. This suggests that an equilibrium between CRF and NPY neuronal function within the PVN may play an important role in the regulation of food intake. This interactive mechanism may provide some partial explanation of the eating disorders related to stress, in particular anorexia nervosa."
"['Carr KD', 'Papadouka V.']",The role of multiple opioid receptors in the potentiation of reward by food restriction.,Brain Res,"Chronic food restriction and weight loss were previously shown to produce a naltrexone-reversible facilitation of perifornical lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation. In the present study, high affinity receptor-selective antagonists were used to determine the particular opioid receptor type(s) that mediates the facilitation of reward by food restriction. Separate groups of food-restricted and ad libitum fed rats were used to conduct i.c.v. dose-response studies with TCTAP (mu), norbinaltorphimine (kappa), and naltrindole (delta). The highest dose of naltrindole (50.0 nmol) raised self-stimulation threshold independently of feeding condition. This suggests that delta opioid activity is involved in self-stimulation under basal conditions and may explain previous findings that high systemic doses of naloxone or naltrexone reduce self-stimulation. The highest doses of TCTAP and norbinaltorphimine (5.0 and 50.0 nmol, respectively) reversed the lowering of self-stimulation threshold produced by food restriction while having no effect on thresholds of ad libitum fed rats. These results suggest that state-dependent mu and kappa opioid activity facilitate reward. Since food restriction is known to increase the rewarding effect of food and drugs of abuse, the opioid mechanism identified in the present study may mediate adaptive behavior and, under some circumstances, pathological behavior. The possible relation of state-dependent opioid activity to Anorexia Nervosa, binge eating, and the high comorbidity of eating disorders and substance abuse is discussed."

Rats increased their daily running up to distances between 7 and 11 km compared to the maximum 2.5 km in controls fed ad libitum. The hypothalamic noradrenaline (NE) turnover, as estimated by the concentration of the major metabolite MHPG, was significantly decreased in semistarved sedentary rats compared to controls. Hyperactivity resulted in marked elevation of NE turnover at all time points examined. Semistarvation-induced decreases of dopamine (DA) turnover as estimated by the concentrations of its major metabolite DOPAC, could also be compensated by hyperactivity. The circadian pattern of NE turnover parallels the pattern of running activity. MHPG levels at times of high activity were even higher than in controls fed ad libitum (p less than 0.01). The availability of the precursor tyrosine, as indicated by the ratio of plasma tyrosine to the large neutral amino acids, was significantly decreased in semistarvation (p less than 0.0001); hyperactivity caused a further decrease (p less than 0.001), indicating that tyrosine availability is not, under these conditions, a limiting factor for noradrenaline turnover. The combined influence of semistarvation and hyperactivity on central catecholamine turnover in the rat is discussed as an animal model for the effects of malnutrition and heavy exercise often observed in anorexia nervosa."

Recent indirect evidence indicates that one of the signals encoded in the structure of neuropeptide Y (NPY) is to stimulate robust feeding. Therefore, two series of experiments were undertaken to characterize NPY secretion within the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in association with eating behavior in the rat. Dynamic changes in NPY concentration in several hypothalamic sites and release in the PVN were assessed before and during the course of food consumption in rats trained to eat daily only for 4 h. Only in the PVN were NPY concentrations elevated before the introduction of food and, thereafter, levels decreased significantly during the course of eating. A similar temporal pattern in NPY release into the PVN interstitium was evident in samples collected by push-pull cannula perfusion in unrestrained rats. In addition, in food-deprived rats displaying a robust drive for feeding, NPY release in the PVN was also markedly enhanced in the shape of high-amplitude secretory episodes as compared to a lower release rate in rats receiving food ad libitum. The higher rate of NPY release in fasted rats returned to the control range after 24 h of ad libitum food supply. These findings of intense and dynamic NPY neurosecretory activity within a discrete hypothalamic site in association with an increased drive for food consumption demonstrate that NPY release in the PVN is an important orexigenic signal for periodic eating behavior. These results have important global implications for elucidating the underlying causes of the pathophysiology of eating disorders--anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and obesity--as well as constituting a specific contextual model for the formulation and testing of suitable NPY receptor agonists and antagonists for therapeutic intervention."

We have conducted a series of clinical studies with oCRH and hCRH in volunteers and patients with various disorders of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. In volunteers, it was demonstrated that hCRH administration produced ACTH and cortisol responses which closely mimic naturalistically occurring secretory episodes. This data, as well as the demonstration that pulsatile hCRH can reestablish normal ACTH and cortisol secretion in patients with hypothalamic CRH deficiency, strongly argue that CRH is of physiological relevance to the human pituitary-adrenal axis. However, since the ACTH response to an insulin tolerance test is greater than the maximal ACTH response to CRH, other factors such as vasopressin may be relevant to stress-induced ACTH secretion in man. Following the demonstration that CRH seems to be of physiological relevance to human subjects, a CRH stimulation test was developed based on pharmacokinetic and dose response studies with oCRH and hCRH. Based on these data, which revealed that oCRH functions as a long-acting analogue of hCRH, and the demonstration that hormonal responses to CRH are greatest in the evening, patient groups with abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis were tested with intravenous oCRH with a dose of 1 micrograms/kg given at 2000 hours. This CRH stimulation test has proved helpful in clarifying the pathophysiology of hypercortisolism in a variety of psychiatric disorders characterized by this endocrine abnormality. Thus, blunted ACTH responses in hypercortisolemic patients with depression, anorexia nervosa, and panic anxiety disorder indicate normality of the pituitary corticotroph in these patient subgroups. These data, along with the finding that a continuous infusion of CRH to normal volunteers, reproduces the pattern and magnitude of hypercortisolism in depression and anorexia nervosa, suggest that the hypercortisolism in these disorders represents a defect at or above the hypothalamus resulting in the hypersecretion of CRH. This hypothesis is particularly intriguing in light of the demonstration that CRH administration to experimental animals produces many of the physiological and behavioral responses classically associated with depression and anorexia nervosa, including hypercortisolism, hypothalamic hypogonadism, and decreases in libido and appetite. The CRH stimulation test has also helped to resolve one of the oldest endocrinological dilemmas, namely whether the hypercortisolism of depression and Cushing's disease share a common or dissimilar pathophysiological basis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

However, little is known about the impact of early life experiences on appetitive responses. The present investigation assessed the effects of brief handling/separation or protracted separation from the dams, on feeding and anxiety responses during development. During the first 3 weeks post-partum, Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed daily to either brief (15 min) handling/isolation (H), a more protracted (3 h) period of maternal separation (MS), or were not handled (NH). When tested on the elevated plus-maze (at 5-6 weeks) H groups displayed less anxiety than NH gender-matched controls. Surprisingly, so did the MS females. At weaning (Day 22), the MS rats weighed significantly less than both the H and NH animals; the difference between the H and MS was more robust and persisted throughout the experiment (D 62). The H animals of both genders, and the females of the MS group, consumed more of the palatable 'snack' than their NH counterparts. The feeding suppressant response to the various satiety peptides (bombesin, cholecystokinin, and amylin) was not affected by the early life experience, with exception of cholecystokinin (CCK) effects, which were more pronounced in H and MS males. These results suggest that early life events may contribute to anxiety and/or ingestive disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia and obesity."

We previously reported that CTRP13 expression is increased in obese and hyperphagic leptin-deficient mice, suggesting that it may modulate food intake and body weight. CTRP13 is also expressed in the brain, although its role in modulating whole-body energy balance remains unknown. Here, we show that CTRP13 is a novel anorexigenic factor in the mouse brain. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that food restriction downregulates Ctrp13 expression in mouse hypothalamus, while high-fat feeding upregulates expression. Central administration of recombinant CTRP13 suppressed food intake and reduced body weight in mice. Further, CTRP13 and the orexigenic neuropeptide agouti-related protein (AgRP) reciprocally regulate each other's expression in the hypothalamus: central delivery of CTRP13 suppressed Agrp expression, while delivery of AgRP increased Ctrp13 expression. Food restriction alone reduced Ctrp13 and increased orexigenic neuropeptide gene (Npy and Agrp) expression in the hypothalamus; in contrast, when food restriction was coupled to enhanced physical activity in an activity-based anorexia (ABA) mouse model, hypothalamic expression of both Ctrp13 and Agrp were upregulated. Taken together, these results suggest that CTRP13 and AgRP form a hypothalamic feedback loop to modulate food intake and that this neural circuit may be disrupted in an anorexic-like condition."

In addition, spontaneous elevation of GH occurs during the day, and a rise in GH occurs in association with the initial slow-wave sleep episode at night. Although the identity of the long-sought GH releasing factor has not yet been established, a hypothalamic factor inhibiting GH release named somatostatin has been identified and synthesized. Most, if not all, of the GH rises are mediated by neural mechanisms, and therefore they may be disrupted by many disease processes affecting the pituitary or the hypothalamus..."
['Wang SW.'],Effects of restraint stress and serotonin on macronutrient selection: a rat model of stress-induced anorexia.,Eat Weight Disord,"The present study investigated the effects of brief (20 min), acute (2 hr) and chronic restraint stress (2 hr/day for five days) at the time of dark onset on macronutrient selection in female Wistar rats. The role of 5-HT1A receptors in nutrient intake was also examined in a dose-response study (100-700 microg/kg body weight) of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (DPAT) in an acute restraint model. A total of 200 rats aged 6-12 months were tested. In all cases, the restraint stress took the form of confinement within tight-fitting cylinder tubes. In the brief and acute paradigms, the intake of pure carbohydrate (CHO), protein (PRO), and fat was measured for 40 min after a single exposure to stress; in the chronic model, nutrient intake was assessed for 40 min only after the final restraint stress session on day 5. In the DPAT paradigm, intraperitoneal injections of the 5-HT1A agonist were given prior to acute restraint and a 40 min session of nutrient self-selection. Statistical analysis using the t-test for independent samples revealed that neither PRO nor total intake was significantly altered by restraint in the brief, acute or chronic restraint experiments, whereas CHO consumption was suppressed by acute (p=0.02) and chronic restraint (p=0.021), and fat intake was suppressed by brief (p=0.010), acute (p=0.002) and chronic restraint (p=0.001). In the DPAT paradigm, acute restraint stress suppressed CHO (p=0.0001), fat (p=0.000001) and total intake (p=0.003). These effects were not reversed by DPAT, and the administration of 300 pg/kg actually further reduced fat intake. In conclusion, fat intake is more sensitive to the suppressive effects of restraint stress than CHO intake, whereas protein intake is unaffected. Furthermore, 5-HT1A receptors do not seem to play a role in the effects of acute restraint on CHO and fat intake."

Endocannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors are found in the hypothalamus and brainstem, which are central areas involved in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. Activation of these areas is related to hypophagia observed during inflammatory stimulus. This study investigated the effects of cannabinoid (CB₁) receptor blockade on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hypophagia. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with rimonabant (10 mg/kg, by gavage) or vehicle; 30 min later they received an injection of either LPS (100 μg/kg, intraperitoneal) or saline. Food intake, body weight, corticosterone response, CRF and CART mRNA expression, Fos-CRF and Fos-α-MSH immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus and Fos-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the brainstem were evaluated. LPS administration decreased food intake and body weight gain and increased plasma corticosterone levels and CRF mRNA expression in the PVN. We also observed an increase in Fos-CRF and Fos-TH double-labeled neurons after LPS injection in vehicle-pretreated rats, with no changes in CART mRNA or Fos-α-MSH immunoreactive neurons in the ARC. In saline-treated animals, rimonabant pretreatment decreased food intake and body weight gain but did not modify hormone response or Fos expression in the hypothalamus and brainstem compared with vehicle-pretreated rats. Rimonabant pretreatment potentiated LPS-induced hypophagia, body weight loss and Fos-CRF and Fos-TH expressing neurons. Rimonabant did not modify corticosterone, CRF mRNA or Fos-α-MSH responses in rats treated with LPS. These data suggest that the endocannabinoid system, mediated by CB₁ receptors, modulates hypothalamic and brainstem circuitry underlying the hypophagic effect during endotoxemia to prevent an exaggerated food intake decrease.

DDC injected 5 h prior to ether stress stimulated ACTH and corticosterone (B) during this time, and there was no further HPA response to ether. To control for elevated B feedback in DDC effects on HPA responses to ether, rats were adrenalectomized (Adx) and replaced with no (0% B), moderate (40% B) and high (80% B) levels of steroid 5 d prior to DDC or saline with ether stress 5 h later; Sham-Adx rats were included. In Adx rats increasing B inhibited thymus weight, median eminence CRF content, pituitary and plasma ACTH. In saline-treated rats, ether 5 h later caused increased CRF content and plasma ACTH in Sham-Adx and Adx, 0% B, increased ACTH in Adx, 40% B, and no response in Adx, 80% B. B treatment did not alter catecholamine content, and DDC treatment reduced NE content in the paraventricular nuclei by 50-60% in all groups. 5 h after DDC, pituitary ACTH was decreased in all rats with B and plasma ACTH was increased in sham-Adx and Adx, 40% B; thus DDC caused significant, prolonged stress which should facilitate subsequent HPA responses to acute stress. There was no HPA response to ether in Sham-Adx, Adx, 0% or 40% B groups, but there was a marked ACTH response to ether in the Adx, 80% B group treated with DDC. We conclude that: 1) the HPA response to ether stress is probably mediated by catecholamines; 2) DDC does not stimulate responses in the HPA axis in the absence of B; and, 3) facilitation of HPA responses to acute stress depends on increased steady-state B signals. Facilitated responses are probably not mediated by catecholamines. The consequence of facilitation is that under conditions of chronic stress and elevated B concentrations, as in depression or anorexia nervosa in man, or adjuvent-induced arthritis in rats, the HPA axis is continually responsive to new stimuli."

This RIA was specific for IGF-II and cross-reactivity with IGF-I was 1%. The sensitivity was 15 pg/tube with 50% displacement at 50 pg/tube. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation for IGF-II were 6.3 and 9.3%, respectively. The plasma IGF-II levels in normal adults, patients with hypopituitarism and patients with active acromegaly were 589.6 +/- 15.8, 800.9 +/- 45.6 and 330.3 +/- 24.3 ng/ml, respectively. After human growth hormone (hGH) treatment in hypopituitarism, IGF-II slightly increased, but not significantly. After adenomectomy in patients with acromegaly, IGF-II significantly decreased. These data indicate that IGF-II concentrations in plasma were partially GH dependent. This GH dependency was less than that of IGF-I. IGF-II was low in patients with anorexia nervosa and with liver cirrhosis and high in patients with renal failure. In two cases with extrapancreatic tumor-associated hypoglycemia, plasma IGF-II was increased to 1123.8 and 843.5 ng/ml, and returned to normal after tumor resection. These data showed that IGF-II was partly dependent on GH and nutritional conditions and that IGF-II was the most likely cause of some cases of hypoglycemia with extrapancreatic tumor. This specific and sensitive RIA of IGF-II would be useful in evaluating its physiological and pathological role in plasma and tissue."

The greatest degree of dietary hyperphagia is induced by giving rats or mice access to a daily choice of highly palatable foods (e.g., chocolate or bread) in addition to their regular chow. Like humans, rats overeat and actually develop physiological requirements for these foods. This model can be used to test the effects of putative anorectic agents on both acute and chronic administration regimens. The second protocol describes a model of compulsive behavior that results in profound weight loss, which is produced by moderate food deprivation along with continuous access to exercise wheels."
"['Yamauchi T', 'Inoue K', 'Iwasaki S', 'Muramatsu T', 'Hayashi T', 'Kiriike N.']",Intracerebroventricular administration of leptin increases anxiety-like behavior in female rats after semi-starvation--implications for anxiety in eating disorders.,Osaka City Med J,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with eating disorders often exhibit abnormal eating conditions like food restriction, adipocyte and body weight reduction, and pathologic anxiety-like behavior. The role of leptin, which is recognized as an adipocyte-derived hormone, on anxiety-like behavior in eating disorders is still unclear.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We investigated the role of leptin on anxiety-like behavior with or without semi-starvation using the elevated plus-maze test in adolescent female rats. In our first experiment, anxiety-like behavior was evaluated with the elevated plus-maze test 30 min after intracerebroventricular administration of 3 microg of leptin or vehicle. In our second experiment, the rats were allowed access to food for only 2 hr each day for 7 days. Then, leptin or vehicle was administered to the rats after the last 2 hr feeding period, and anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated in the same way as in the first experiment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the first experiment, there was no difference between the anxiety-like behaviors observed after leptin administration and those seen after vehicle administration. Under the conditions of semi-starvation, however, the percentage of time spent in the open arms in the rats given leptin was lower than that in rats given vehicle.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results suggest that leptin administration causes anxiety-like behavior only after semistarvation. Leptin might play an important role in pathologic anxiety-like behavior in eating disorders."
"['Lauzurica N', 'García-García L', 'Fuentes JA', 'Delgado M.']",Hypophagia and induction of serotonin transporter gene expression in raphe nuclei of male and female rats after short-term fluoxetine treatment.,J Physiol Biochem,"Serotonin (5-HT) is one of the regulators of feeding in humans. Drugs acting on the serotoninergic system are used to treat bulimia nervosa and to enhance the effect of hypocaloric diets in overweight subjects. They act rapidly to normalise feeding when used to treat eating-related problems. To explore the role of the 5-HT transporter (serotonin transporter (SERT)) in the short-term action of serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, rats were i.p. given the drug for five consecutive days. Acute administration of fluoxetine in male and female rats produced a strong reduction in food intake, an effect that held up when daily treatment was maintained for five consecutive days. This reduction translated into a diminution of body weight that was statistically significant in the case of the males. As a reflection of the body weight change in rats killed after the fifth daily drug injection, retroperitoneal fat pad also decreased; a diminution that was statistically significant in the case of male rats. In these conditions, plasma leptin levels of both male and female rats were lower than in untreated animals. While acute fluoxetine administration did not modify SERT gene expression, subchronic drug treatment increased the content of SERT mRNA in the midbrain raphe complex of both rat genders. These findings may contribute to explain the role of SERT in fluoxetine action on binging and as an adjunct to hypocaloric diets."
"['Rosen LB', 'Majzoub JA', 'Adler GK.']",Effects of glucocorticoid on corticotropin-releasing hormone gene regulation by second messenger pathways in NPLC and AtT-20 cells.,Endocrinology,"We have examined the regulation of the hypothalamic secretagogue CRH by glucocorticoid and the protein kinase-A and -C second messenger pathways in cultured cells. We show that the human primary liver carcinoma NPLC expresses the endogenous CRH gene. Dexamethasone reduced CRH mRNA levels by more than 90%, with half-maximal suppression at 5 nM. Phorbol ester treatment to activate the protein kinase-C pathway increased CRH mRNA levels up to 30-fold, whereas forskolin treatment to activate the protein kinase-A pathway had no effect. In coincubation experiments, dexamethasone completely suppressed phorbol ester-induced CRH mRNA levels in NPLC cells, maintaining them at the levels seen in untreated cells. We contrasted this regulation with the effects of glucocorticoid on CRH mRNA induction by forskolin in R1, a mouse anterior pituitary cell line (AtT-20) stably transfected with the human CRH gene. Dexamethasone suppressed forskolin-induced CRH mRNA levels by 70% in R1 cells, but only to levels that were still 10-fold greater than those in untreated cells. These results suggest that CRH induction in vivo by ligands that act via protein kinase-A may be less effectively suppressed by glucocorticoid feedback than CRH induction by ligands that act via protein kinase-C. This differential effect of glucocorticoid on CRH mRNA regulation could help explain the abnormal CRH production observed in clinical disorders such as anorexia nervosa and major depression."

For several days before CDP testing began, rats lived in activity wheels and had one 60-min meal per day. During CDP testing, this regimen continued except that each rat was injected with an appropriate dose of CDP or saline 30 min before each meal. CDP enhanced food intake; 5.0 mg/kg seemed most effective. However, the CDP-induced increase in eating did not noticeably stem weight loss. In Experiment 2, after several days of AA training, CDP (5.0 mg/kg) was tested under less severe conditions; food remained restricted, but access to the wheels was discontinued. Rats given CDP ate more and gained more weight than controls. These findings suggest that benzodiazepines such as CDP may help in treating anorexia nervosa and other anorectic conditions in humans."
"['Endou M', 'Yanai K', 'Sakurai E', 'Fukudo S', 'Hongo M', 'Watanabe T.']",Food-deprived activity stress decreased the activity of the histaminergic neuron system in rats.,Brain Res,"The hypothalamus, which is rich in histaminergic neurons, is highly sensitive to aversive stimuli such as stress. Histamine H3 receptors, which regulate histamine release from the presynaptic site, are associated with stress-induced brain activity. In this study, we investigated the changes of histamine content and histamine H1 and H3 receptors in the brains of rats subjected to stress induced through food deprivation and physical activity on a running wheel (food-deprived activity stress). For purposes of comparison, we also examined the stressful effects of forced swimming on the histaminergic neuron system of rats. The H3 receptor density rapidly declined in the acute phase of stress but gradually returned to the control level in the chronic phase. On the other hand, the H1 receptor slowly decreased and remained at a low level during the chronic phase. These results reveal that there is a discrepancy between the levels of H1 and H3 receptors in the acute and chronic phases of stress. Brain histamine content gradually increased during the late phase of both food-deprived activity stress and forced swimming stress. These changes presumably resulted in the inhibition of histaminergic neuronal activity in the chronic stress condition. In accordance with this hypothesis, the intraventricular administration of histamine significantly reduced the hyperactivity caused by food-deprived activity stress. Since extensive exercise and restricted feeding are thought to be associated with anorexia nervosa, the abnormalities in the histaminergic neuron system might contribute to trait status in anorexia nervosa."

Yet, it is unknown whether anyone who will ultimately suffer from anorexia is already ill upon ""going on a diet"", or whether disease begins during, and is perhaps triggered by, dieting. The objective of the following study was to precipitate anorexia by imposing diet restriction on animals, as a model for generating AN in humans. Three hundred young female Sabra mice were diet restricted to 40% of daily nutrient requirements for 12 days, lost 17% of body weight and were then re-fed ad-lib. All mice regained appetite and weight. Our conclusions are that diet restriction does not precipitate anorexia in mice. Our findings do not support a role for diet restriction per se in triggering AN."

Plasma levels of tryptophan higher in the FF rats were comparable in the starved and fed groups of RF rats. Plasma levels of glucose comparable in the FF and RF fed rats were smaller in the starved animals. Brain levels of tryptophan comparable in the RF fed rats and FF controls were smaller in RF starved rats.

Possible implication of the findings in the pathogenesis of food deprivation/starvation related disease, anorexia nervosa is discussed."
"['Müller EE', 'Rolla M.']",Aspects of the neuroendocrine control of somatotropic function in calorically restricted dogs and patients with eating disorders: studies with cholinergic drugs.,Psychiatry Res,"A series of studies was devised in both an experimental model of food deprivation, i.e., beagle dogs undergoing a progressive reduction of calorie intake and adolescent females with anorexia nervosa (AN) in the acute and recovery phase, and in patients with atypical eating disorders. The studies were aimed at ascertaining whether the alleged function of the hypothalamic system inhibitory to growth hormone (GH) secretion, i.e., the somatostatinergic, may account for at least some of the abnormalities of GH secretion present in AN patients (e.g., elevated basal GH levels, paradoxical GH rise after glucose or thyrotropin releasing hormone, etc). Caloric restricted dogs or patients with eating disorders were given an intravenous injection of the physiologic GH-releasing peptide GHRH alone or preceded by pirenzepine, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist reportedly capable of eliciting hypothalamic release of somatostatin (SS), or pyridostigmine, a muscarinic cholinergic agonist which, conversely, would restrain hypothalamic release of SS. In addition, dogs were challenged with acute administration of glucose or thyrotropin-releasing hormone, compounds also thought to act via somatostatinergic influences. Data obtained in dogs under caloric restriction or in AN patients in the acute phase of the disease with drugs affecting cholinergic transmission suggest that the latter is increased in both conditions (only partial suppression of the GHRH-induced GH rise with pirenzepine, failure of pyridostigmine to further enhance the GH response to GHRH). Instead, in the same AN patients in the acute phase tested during recovery, in AN patients during the recovery phase, and in patients with atypical eating disorders, pirenzepine completely suppressed the GH response to GHRH, as it did in controls. Finally, data obtained on basal and GHRH-stimulated GH release in dogs given glucose or thyrotropin-releasing hormone and in AN patients given arginine, another compound thought to act via inhibition of somatostatinergic influences, do not support the view that somatostatinergic function is impaired in states of food deprivation."
"['Myers RD', 'Hepler JR', 'Holahan W.']",Action of anorexigenic peptide injected into the brain: dissociation of effect on body weight and feeding in the rat.,Peptides,"Previous reports on the effect of anorexigenic peptide (AXP) administered systemically in the rodent are inconsistent in terms of the effect of the tri-peptide on food intake and body weight. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of AXP infused into the brain on these measures. In post-pubescent female rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain, guide cannulae were permanently implanted in the lateral cerebral ventricle for repeated intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion. Postoperatively, measures of food and water intake and body weight were obtained every day at the same time. After a 7-day base-line period, AXP was infused bilaterally in a total volume of 15 microliter and in a dose of either 0.25 microgram (n=7) or 1.25 micrograms (n=5), with artificial CSF vehicle serving as the control solution (n=6). ICV infusions were given once daily for 20 consecutive days, after which the same intake and body weight measures were recorded for another 7-day period. The rats given 0.25 micrograms AXP showed a significant suppression in weight gain with the overall slope of the growth curve being 0.358. In contrast, the growth slope of the rats given the 1.25 micrograms dose of AXP was 0.621, whereas those given the CSF was 0.823. Although the trends of intake of food tended to follow the curves of the rats body weight, the difference between g/kg food intake of rats during ICV infusions of either dose of AXP was not significantly different from that of the CSF controls. Water intake also was unaffected by either dose of AXP. These results demonstrate that this tri-peptide derived from urine of patients afflicted with anorexia nervosa exerts a direct effect on the brain. Since the 0.25 micrograms dose of AXP infused acutely ICV caused a sustained hyperthermia, its mechanism of action is apparently a metabolic one; that is, the interruption in the gain in body weight of the rat is independent of the amount of food it ingests."

"['Lett BT', 'Grant VL', 'Smith JF', 'Koh MT.']",Preadaptation to the feeding schedule does not eliminate activity-based anorexia in rats.,Q J Exp Psychol B,"To test whether activity-based anorexia (ABA) still occurs after preadaptation to the feeding schedule, 20 rats were first exposed to a feeding schedule of one 90-min meal per day until adaptation occurred (measured by maintenance of stable body weight). Then, during ABA training, half the rats (wheel group) were confined in running wheels except during the daily meal, and half (cage group) were not. Wheel running suppressed feeding--that is, food intake in the wheel group was less than that in the cage group. Also, the rats in the wheel group lost weight, whereas those in the cage group did not. Wheel running increased over days. Thus, the defining characteristics of ABA were evident in rats that were not subjected to ABA training until after they had become well adapted to the feeding schedule. These findings support the view that the suppression of feeding produced by wheel running triggers the vicious circle of ABA. They also cast doubt on the hypothesis that activity-induced interference with adaptation to the feeding schedule plays a key role in causing ABA."

Contradictory findings about the role of leptin as a link between nutritional status and bone physiology have been reported. We demonstrate that leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-resistant db/db male mice have increased plasma osteocalcin, and that in male ob/ob mice osteocalcin is not decreased by starvation, unlike control mice. Intraperitoneal leptin administration increased plasma osteocalcin in male ob/ob mice, and prevented its fall during 24h fasting and 5 days of food restriction in normal male mice. This effect may be mediated via actions on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular or -growth hormone axes, or a direct action on osteoblasts. These studies support the hypothesis that the fall in leptin during starvation and weight loss is responsible for the associated reduction in osteoblast activity, and suggest a role for leptin in regulating bone turnover."
['Murray JB.'],New trends in psychosomatic research.,Genet Psychol Monogr,"Advances in physiological psychology and neuroendocrinology, together with epidemiological studies, have added new dimensions to psychosomatic research. Psychological influences still are accepted as exacerbators or trigger mechanisms, if less often as causes. Theories of psychosomatics which connected specific personality profiles with specific psychosomatic illnesses have lost favor, and multifactorial explanations, which include heredity, environment, social class, life stress, endocrines, brain areas, neurohormones, and immunological mechanisms, are new areas of research. Research methods have become more sophisticated scientifically, particularly in the selection and size of samples tested, and the variety of situations investigated. Psychological reactions to illness in general, terminal disease, and death, and psychological experiences of pain, in addition to variable effects of psychotherapeutic methods and psychotherapists' personality, are identifiable but unquantified influences which seem acceptable as contributors to, if not causes of, psychophysiological disorders."

Confirming previous studies, Experiment 1 showed that food deprivation gave rise to analgesia, as indicated by increased tail-flick latencies, that was antagonized by naloxone. Experiment 2 found that analgesia was greatly reduced after five exposures to periods of 24-h food deprivation (alternating with 24-h free access to food), indicating the development of tolerance. Experiments 3 and 3a examined the development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine following repeated morphine injections, saline injections, and exposure to 24-h food deprivation plus saline injections. The combined results of both experiments provided evidence that repeated exposures to either morphine or food deprivation, produced greater tolerance to morphine than did exposures to saline. That food deprivation was cross-tolerant with morphine indicated that tolerance to food deprivation-induced analgesia involved opioid mechanisms. The relevance of opioid tolerance to psychobiological models of feeding and to the development of an animal model of anorexia nervosa was discussed."
"['Glowa JR', 'Gold PW.']",Corticotropin releasing hormone produces profound anorexigenic effects in the rhesus monkey.,Neuropeptides,"The behavioral consequences of the central administration of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) in rhesus monkeys was determined using food-maintained behavior. Acute doses of CRH (0.003 ng/kg-10 micrograms/kg, i.c.v.), decreased responding for food in a dose- and time-related manner. With intermediate doses, responding occurred at a high rate until food was delivered, and then abruptly ceased for several minutes. Previous studies have attributed similar effects to the noxious properties of certain drugs. Acute doses had no effect on home cage food consumption, body weight, or responding for food on subsequent days. When CRH was given repeatedly for several days, its behavioral suppressant effects increased. Home cage food intake, body weight, and subsequent responding for food decreased for up to 6 weeks before returning to normal. These results suggest that sustained elevations in central levels of CRH can result in a sensitization to its anorexigenic effects, an effect that has not been reported in other species. Because hyperaroused clinical states such as depression and anorexia nervosa are characterized biochemically by hypercortisolism and elevated CRH in CSF, these anorexigenic effects may corroborate a potential role for CRH in affective disorders."

The phenomenon is of interest because of the relationship between exercise and anorexia nervosa. This study determined if another factor that energizes behavior in rats, water deprivation, produces similar exercise-induced weight loss. Rats were maintained on a restricted water schedule (10 min/day) combined with free access to running wheels and food; controls had no wheel access or were food deprived only. Both water-deprived groups consumed similar amounts of food and water, with the exercised group losing more body weight. Plasma osmolality, hematocrit, and posterior pituitary vasopressin content were equivalent in the two water-deprived groups, indicating similar hydrational status. It is concluded that the weight loss effect in water-deprived rats is due to excessive voluntary exercise, and that other factors that energize behavior should produce a similar effect."

['Stevens R.'],Estradiol benzoate potentiates the effects of body-restraint in suppressing food intake and reducing body weight.,Physiol Behav,"Food intakes and body weights were recorded daily over a 15 day period for groups of ovariectomized rats. During days 6-10 rats were injected with estradiol benzoate at one of four concentrations, 0, 0.625 micrograms, 1.25 micrograms, and half the animals in each group were stressed by being restrained in small Plexiglas chambers for 30 min per day. During the treatment period there was a dose response inhibitory effect of estradiol benzoate on intake and body weight that was greater in confined than in unrestrained animals especially at the intermediate dose of estradiol. In the posttreatment period the effect of restraint on intake persisted whereas the hormone effect did not, but the effects of estradiol were apparent on body weight in both confined and unconfined rats. This synergistic relationship between small doses of estrogen and stress in producing anorexic effects provides an animal model of anorexia nervosa; a possible neuroendocrine mechanism that could explain the effect is discussed."

To induce AA, rats (Rattus norvegicus) were maintained in activity wheels and restricted to a single 60-min feeding period each day. As previously found, this procedure suppressed food intake. After several days of this training, food intake was measured 30 min after the rats were injected with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) or saline. In 2 experiments, chlordiazepoxide counteracted the suppression of food intake produced by AA. Because benzodiazepines have been found to increase food intake in many mammalian species including primates, the present results suggest that benzodiazepines could be useful in the treatment of anorexia nervosa."

No differences in taste preferences or sensory estimates were observed for swimmers across the athletic season. However, swimmers had significantly lower preference ratings for high-sucrose and high-fat stimuli than controls. Controls who reported exercising more than 3 h a week also displayed decreased preference ratings for high-sucrose and high-fat stimuli relative to controls who reported exercising less than 3 h a week. With respect to sensory estimates, swimmers reported that high-sucrose stimuli were sweeter, low-fat stimuli were less fatty, and high-fat stimuli were more fatty than controls. The preference ratings and sensory estimates of these athletes were similar to those previously seen in individuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia."

"['Hochberg Z', 'Youdim MB', 'Amit T.']",A mathematical model for appraisal of the impact of GH binding protein on GH receptor binding.,Growth Regul,"Discrepancies between GH measurements and growth rate of children have complicated diagnosis in a variety of clinical conditions. The competition of GH-BP with the GH-receptor towards GH-receptor binding can have a role in these discrepancies. A mathematical model was developed for appraising the availability of GH for receptor binding from measurements of serum GH by RIA and serum GH binding protein (BP) by a binding assay. Eighteen patients with high GH-BP (obesity), normal GH-BP (normal control) or low GH-BP (children, anorexia nervosa or cirrhosis of the liver) were the subjects of this study. Sera of patients with high, normal or low GH-BP levels were analyzed for their competition with [125I]hGH binding to rabbit liver membranes. Serum GH was measured by a commercial polyclonal RIA. Serum GH-BP was measured by a binding assay with dextran-coated charcoal separation. Receptor availability for GH was assessed by displacing of [125I]hGH from rabbit liver membranes. The decline in receptor availability for each hGH value, caused by GH-BP competition with the receptor, was calculated by subtraction of the percent displacement in the absence of GH-BP from the percent displacement in the presence of a given GH-BP value. The results were analyzed statistically to give a series of polynomes. These enabled the calculation of an activity factor for serum RIA GH levels, that should predict the receptor availability of each GH level, according to the concomitant GH-BP level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

To test this hypothesis, we tested the effects of sera with low GH-BP levels (obtained from prepubertal children, girls with anorexia nervosa [AN], and patients with hepatic cirrhosis), normal control sera, and sera with high GH-BP levels (obtained from obese patients) on hGH binding to its receptors. GH-BP activity in patients' sera was measured by incubation with [125I]hGH and the separation of bound hGH from free hGH with dextran-coated charcoal. The effect of GH-BP was studied by preincubation of patients' sera with increasing concentrations of hGH, followed by incubation with [125I]hGH and a rabbit liver membrane preparation known to be rich in GH receptors, and finally by measuring hGH bound to the receptors. In this study, we report on the ability of GH-BP to reduce the inhibitory capacity (IC50) of hGH on [125I]hGH binding to GH receptors. The concentration of GH-BP in serum is positively correlated with the IC50 of hGH incubated with different sera on [125I]hGH binding to its receptors (n = 21; r = .886, P less than .001). In the presence of high serum GH-BP levels, such as those observed in obesity (20.13% +/- 0.71%/0.05 mL serum), the IC50 values were significantly higher than those obtained with sera containing GH-BP levels lower than those measured in human control subjects, such as from prepubertal children, AN patients, and cirrhotic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The dilution curves of plasma and CSF showed good linearity, and the recovery was 83.2-95.6%. There was good correlation between plasma leptin concentrations by the ELISA and a commercially available RIA (r = 0.99). Our ELISA is advantageous because it does not require radioisotopes, it produces results in hours rather than days, and more importantly, it improves on the detection limit and plasma interference of the RIA kit.

Rhesus monkeys were equipped with a novel intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) cannula system and trained to respond under operant schedules of food presentation or termination of stimuli associated with the delivery of shock (escape). 2. CRH decreased food-maintained behavior in a dose-related manner over the range of (0.3-10 micrograms/kg) but did not affect escape responding, demonstrating a selective effect on food-maintained responding. 3. This selective effect was related to the tendency for responding to stop after delivery of a food pellet when higher doses of CRH were given, consistent with the notion that a conditioned aversion to food was established in the presence of CRH. 4. This may suggest that in hyperaroused clinical states such as depression and anorexia nervosa, focus is shifted away from appetitive tasks as a result of increased levels of CRH."

The food intake of sham-operated (sham) rats given an isoleucine-imbalanced (IMB) diet was reduced to < 40% of control basal (BAS) diet intake (P = 0.0009), and pretreatment with the 5-HT3 antagonist tropisetron (Trop) increased IMB intake by twofold over the vehicle (VEH)-treated group (P < or = 0.0001), as we have reported before. However, after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (VAGX), IMB intake was increased to a level intermediate between the sham-VEH and sham-Trop groups, while administration of Trop did not increase IMB intake over VAGX alone. By the end of day 1, the VAGX-Trop group had eaten only 1 g more of IMB than the VAGX-VEH group (NS). We conclude that 1) the vagus is among the physiological systems involved in the anorectic responses to IMB and 2) intact vagal function is necessary for the full effect of 5-HT3 antagonists in alleviating the anorectic responses to IMB."

The body weight was reduced by 41% and the heart weight by 38% in these starving periods. The 125I-iodocyanopindrol (ICYP) binding capacity of heart preparations from the starved rats was 35.3 +/- 11.1 (mean +/- SD) fmol/mg protein in comparison with 69.3 +/- 14.9 for the controls. Serum 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine and TSH levels as well as pituitary TSH contents were markedly lower in the starved rats. One group of them further received 20 ng of T3 daily after the 8th day of the experiment. The body weight decreased by 47% of the controls but the ICYP binding capacity recovered to 56.3 +/- 10.9 fmol/mg protein. There was no difference in association constants of the receptors in these three groups. It was concluded that quasi-chronic starvation in rats caused a remarkable decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in heart and this was partly offset by the substitution of T3."

      During activity-based anorexia (ABA) in mice, enhanced paracellular permeability and reduced protein synthesis have been shown in the colon while the gut-brain axis has received increasing attention in the regulation of intestinal and mood disorders that frequently occur during anorexia nervosa, a severe eating disorder for which there is no specific treatment. In the present study, we assessed the effects of oral glutamine (Gln) or branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) supplementation during ABA to target intestinal functions, body composition and feeding behavior.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      C57BL/6 male mice were randomized in Control (CTRL) and ABA groups. After ABA induction, mice received, or not, either 1% Gln or 2.5% BCAA (Leu, Ile, Val) for one week in drinking water.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Neither Gln nor BCAA supplementation affected body weight and body composition, while only Gln supplementation slightly increased food intake. ABA mice exhibited increased paracellular permeability and reduced protein synthesis in the colonic mucosa. Oral Gln restored colonic paracellular permeability and protein synthesis and increased the mucin-2 mRNA level, whereas BCAA did not affect colonic parameters.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In conclusion, oral Gln specifically improves colonic response during ABA. These data should be further confirmed in AN patients."

Among rats who responded to methylphenidate (weight loss of 15-25%) weeks after its administration, a group of 6 rats continued to receive only methylphenidate (""Met"" group), and another group received 10 mg/kg/d of mifepristone in addition to methylphenidate for 18 days (""Met+Mif"" group; n = 6). The mean weight of the ""Met+Mif"" group remained significantly lower when compared to the control group (87.63 ± 2.83% vs 96.29 ± 3.26%; p < 0.001 respectively) but was significantly higher than that of the ""Met"" group (87.63 ± 2.83% vs. 80.61 ± 3.52%; p < 0.001 respectively). Plasma concentrations of adiponectin and gene expression of its receptors in rats brain were significantly higher in the ""Met"" group as compared to the ""Met+Mif"" and control groups (p < 0.01). Accordingly, mifepristone reduces HPA axis activation and restores weight through adipose tissue recovering. It might be considered a promising treatment for anorexia nervosa patients in future studies."

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) regulates BP and its dysregulation contributes to impaired cardiovascular function. Female Fischer rats were maintained on a control (CT) or severe FR (40% of CT) diet for 14 days. In response to severe FR, BP allostasis was achieved by up-regulating circulating Ang-[1-8] by 1.3-fold through increased angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and by increasing the expression of AT1Rs 1.7-fold in mesenteric vessels. Activation of the RAS countered the depressor effect of the severe plasma volume reduction (≥30%). The RAS, however, still underperformed as evidenced by reduced pressor responses to Ang-[1-8] even though AT1Rs were still responsive to the depressor effects of an AT1R antagonist. The aldosterone (ALDO) response was also inadequate as no changes in plasma ALDO were observed after the large fall in plasma volume. These findings have implications for individuals who have experienced a period(s) of severe FR (e.g., anorexia nervosa, dieters, natural disasters) and suggests increased activity of the RAS in order to achieve allostasis contributes to the cardiovascular dysfunction associated with inadequate food intake."
"['Grunberger G', 'Taylor SI', 'Dons RF', 'Gorden P.']",Insulin receptors in normal and disease states.,Clin Endocrinol Metab,"The binding of insulin to its receptor has been studied under various physiological and pathological conditions. Quantitative studies have involved human circulating cells such as monocytes and erythrocytes, adipocytes, placental cells, and cultured cells such as fibroblasts and transformed lymphocytes. In animals, other target tissues such as liver and muscle have been studied and correlated with the human studies. Various physiological conditions such as diurnal rhythm, diet, age, exercise and the menstrual cycle affect insulin binding; in addition, many drugs perturb the receptor interaction. Disease affecting the insulin receptor can be divided into five general categories: (1) Receptor regulation--this involves diseases characterized by hyper- or hypoinsulinaemia. Hyperinsulinaemia in the basal state usually leads to receptor 'down' regulation as seen in obesity, type II diabetes, acromegaly and islet cell tumours. Hypoinsulinaemia such as seen in anorexia nervosa or type I diabetes may lead to elevated binding. (2) Antireceptor antibodies--these immunoglobulins bind to the receptor and competitively inhibit insulin binding. They may act as agonists, antagonists or partial agonists. (3) Genetic diseases which produce fixed alterations in both freshly isolated and cultured cells. (4) Diseases of receptor specificity where insulin may bind with different affinity to its own receptor or related receptors such as receptors for insulin-like growth factors. (5) Disease of affinity modulation where physical factors such as pH, temperature, ions, etc. may modify binding. In this review, we have considered primarily abnormality in insulin receptor binding. There are numerous other functions of the receptor such as coupling and transmission of the biological signal. These mechanisms are frequently referred to as postreceptor events, but more properly should be referred to as postbinding events since the receptor subserves other functions in addition to recognition and binding of insulin."
